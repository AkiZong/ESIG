(54, 'The bi-polarization of global economy ', 'The global economy is drifting fast into two global camps: the developed world which is sinking under debt (fiscal deficits); and the emerging economies (including the Frontier risky economies) which are relatively less indebted. More important, the former economies, reeling under debt burden exceeding 200% of GDP, are losing growth momentum as well. On the other hand, the emerging economies with less debt burden are moving faster on the economic growth path.The critical question remains: who would finance/fund the escalating debt burden of the advanced economies? With declining growth rates, the developed countries cannot finance savings internally. This scenario is strengthened further by the risks of deflation due to “deleveraging” of economy as well as sagging consumer demand. Who else could fund the ever growing debts of the developed nations? The most probable candidate, of course, is the group of emerging economies, which will be growing 6-7% on average in the next decade.However, what is the guarantee of this global funding of debt by the emerging economies? It is rather difficult to answer this question at this stage. All will depend on the perception about vitality of major global currencies including Yen and the US dollar. It is noteworthy that the emerging economies, China and India in particular, are building internal resilience to absorb their savings surpluses and therefore finance their debts without dependence on the foreign sector. This scenario can accentuate divergence in the growth rates between the two camps sharply in the next decade. The critical question facing the developed economies of the world today is: how to mitigate debt burdens without choking growth rates?DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

The Purchasing managers index PMI remained below 50, which separates expansion from contraction. The German economy too has contracted in the month of June.(2)-The Industrial fragility has also spread across America, as the PMI index fell to below 50 in June. The key reason is a degree of sluggishness in the US export sector due to some cooling in the Europe and China.(3)-The Industrial activity has also slowed down in Asia-notably China, India, Brazil & Japan.(4)-The European leaders’ Summit at the end of June made little progress. Recently the European Central Bank (ECB) and People’s Bank of China (PBC) cut policy rates. Both in Canada and the US, the growth in 2012 will be less than originally forecasted.(5)-The tightening of Canada’s mortgage aims to put some checks on already overleveraged Canadian consumers. Toronto and Vancouver have already started to experience cooling of housing market.(6)-With cooling of global growth, Inflation remains subdued in major parts of Asia except India.

The tightened monetary and fiscal policy is sucking oxygen from the already enervated European economies. The key challenge remains: How will Europe cut budget deficits without killing growth?(II)-Two demographic trends are driving the investment landscape in the next decade. There is an explosion in the number of pensioners and longevity of people, in particular in the developed world, due to advances in science and medicine. This will put further stress on governments already reeling under debt burden.(III)-The great bubble of Sovereign debt is gestating-from the US to Japan to a number of European countries. Official US government debt is already 90% of the GDP. The US debt in real terms and after factoring in unfunded obligations for Medicaid, government pensions and other liabilities is over 300 percent of GDP.(IV)-It cannot be ruled out that escalating global debt and sluggish growth are likely to continue for the next decade. The situation can be impacted negatively with three trends: rising unemployment, end of cheap oil and depreciating currencies (dollar in particular).(V)-Creation of currency out of nothing, often called as quantitative easing would lead to depreciating value of dollar, higher interest rates to attract buyers of bonds and finally an era of hyperinflation. It cannot be ruled out this hyperinflation may be preceded by an era of a higher deflation and sluggish economic growth.(VI)-Gold, notwithstanding its recent volatility, will continue to provide a decent hedge against inflation and depreciating currencies. Bullion will also protect against surging oil prices.(VII)-Exchange Traded Funds of precious metals and other Alternative Investments like Participating Whole Life Insurance will provide better returns than fixed income securities like GICs, Treasury Bills, US bonds or other traditional investments.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Flat oil prices will strengthen consumer spending in the days ahead.(E)-Politics of fiscal debt management continues in the Eurozone. This instability is bound to trigger market volatility in the remaining 2012.(F)-The stock markets, both in the US and Canada, are undervalued.

(62, 'Economic oscillations in global financial markets 2012 ', 'Here is a summary of what has happened in the past few months and potential direction of investments:(1)-Economic data and statistics in North America has been trending positive and exceeding expectations. The US Consumer confidence is getting stronger; while Purchasing Managers index is recovering. Despite political dysfunction in the US, there is a degree of optimism about a potential rebounding of the US economy in 2012.(2)-Ever since 2007-2008, the global real rates have been declining consistently. One key factor is relatively stable rate of inflation. Fears of deflation still hang on due to massive deleveraging by the private sector in the US. The current stance of the Fed and other major central banks is to keep the interest rates depressed until 2013.(3)-Oil has surged in the past few months owing to geopolitical tensions with Iran. If Iran were to block strait of Hormuz, it could impact 20% of World oil supply line. OPEC claims to have spare capacity to offset such moves. Oil prices can have inflationary effect in near future, perhaps partially offsetting the decline of prices in the Natural gas sector.(4)-Europe remains a sensitive point for global financial markets. The European GDP has declined reflecting a degree of recession and fiscal tightening due to over-indebted European nations – primarily Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Both non-commercial loan supply and demand conditions have deteriorated in the Eurozone.(5)-The US housing seems to have bottomed with some signs of modest recovery. The incredibly low mortgage rates in combination with depressed prices cut to 1/3rd augur well for the affordability of the housing sector. The three key bottlenecks which prevent a huge rebound are surging inventories, relatively stagnant unemployment and tight credit conditions. The key metrics which are currently negative are mortgage delinquency and home foreclosure rate.(6)-The US consumer spending, in particular of households with income level of $100K to $250K, will determine the pace of US recovery. This category of consumers, numbering at 21 million, accounts for 40% of consumer spending in the US. They are a huge lever and any cautious spending by this class, as demonstrated in the recent surveys, can put brakes on the economy.(7)-The US employment rate is improving consistently; with fall in both jobless claims and lay-offs. The current economic situation warrants job creation of about 100,000 to 150,000 per month. At this pace, it may take another 2-3 years before recovery is achieved.(8)-The Canadian economy is dovetailing the US economy in terms of GDP growth – about 2% in 2012 and almost same threshold in 2013. The three key imbalances characterize the Canadian economy: rising household debt, inflated housing market and current account deficit.(9)-The Fitch ratings recently downgraded India’s credit outlook to negative, commenting that India’s economic outlook will decline without pacing up structural reforms. The key challenge is rising fiscal deficit of the government. The impact is slow economic growth at 5.3% in January, which is lowest in a decade; while hiking inflation continues to pose challenges.(10)-China is poised for soft landing, if not already happened in 2012 and 2013; with potential risks of hard landing in the decade ahead. The main challenge is significant transformation of the Chinese economy. Emerging markets, barring China and India, are lagging behind. All of this points to low global real rates in 2012 and 2013.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(64, 'Is there any difference between value & growth investing? ', 'Let me review the relationship between value and growth first. Value is greatly influenced by growth. The valuation of a company is based on how much cash the company can generate next year. This algorithm is captured in the famous Dividend Discount Model. This model assumes that the value of a company is the cash it will generate next year, divided by the required return minus the long term expected rate of the company’s Cash flows. Clearly, growth plays a critical role in determining the intrinsic value of a company. But there are five key questions to reconcile value of a stock & its assessment of growth potential:1. The sell side research analysis can make optimist assumptions about growth to inflate the value of stock.2. Growth prospects may overshoot the price of stocks-thus creating a divergence between value & growth.3. It is rather difficult to judge the true intrinsic value based on growth standalone as many other factors also go into determination of value of stocks.4. Low P/E values & past growth prospects do not render green signal to buy stocks. Future prospects of growth also matter a lot.5. Past growth prospects cannot guarantee future performance of the stock.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Identify risks of investments, especially reputational, and calculate the margin of safety. Ensure capital preservation of your investment & stay sensitive to economic risks like inflation & interest rates.2. Do your own correct objective analysis without getting influenced by the herd, which in majority of cases will be wrong & converge to median (average) performance.3. The only way to win is to work hardest through voracious reading and application of intellectual curiosity.4. Strive for intellectual curiosity and keep asking three questions: why, why, and why?5. Develop analytical rigor and undertake holistic business analysis, inverting every situation, than merely focusing on markets, macroeconomic or price of stock individually.6. Do not fall in love with investment- be opportunity and situation driven.7. Einstein said that compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. Build patience & do not reverse investments unless there is a reason to do this.8. Become “decisive opportunist” & do not let opportunity slip away.9. Look into the eyes of the ever ‘changing reality’ & adapt (modify) your key ideas.10.

(68, 'The US fiscal outlook looks unpromising ', 'While the current US economic indicators look promising; the US fiscal outlook does not appear to be sustainable. The economy is gaining some traction in key economic variables like retail sales, manufacturing, and housing starts. The key driver of this optimism is exceeding of actual economic figures as compared to estimates. This is yet another question though how accurate are the estimates or were these estimates downgraded due to bleak European look in the last quarter by major analysts? Another key point is the sustainability of these economic trends without the assumption of flat interest rates, which will be demonstrated in the remaining 2012.However, the woes of fiscal management are much more challenging with the procrastination by congressional committees to identify tangible measures for cutting the fiscal deficit by 2021. The future economic uncertainty seems quite looming in the absence of any such concrete measures. If no reasonable consensus is reached by Jan 2013, there is a great risk of reverting to economic recession as the fiscal stimuli would be automatically withdrawn. The debt hangover, coupled with a stagnant housing & job markets, will continue to constrain consumer spending in the US for the coming few years. The European potential recession will dampen the US exports. Overall, the US and global capital markets will remain volatile & recovery quite nascent, at a minimum, as the US economy struggles to cut down fiscal deficit in 2013 & beyond.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(78, 'What drives Revenue Growth? ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: It is important to understand the underlying story behind Revenue growth. Revenue growth that emanates from solid and credible brands in a growth market will have positive consistent impact on margins. Revenue growth underpinned by short term price cuts and aggressive Revenue accounting will fizzle out in long run. It is therefore important to analyze your Revenue drivers before reaching any conclusion about margin improvement. There are uncountable number of factors that may have both direct and indirect impact on Revenue. The three Key factors are summarized below:1.	Volume effects: because of discounts and price cutting. Typically price erosion is equal to List Price minus discount. It may lead to temporary increase in Sales but at the cost of margins. This tactic is employed in organizations where the Sales force is compensated by commissions anchored to Sales Volume.2.	Price effects: Increase in Price can also lead to Revenue growth. However, price increase can be driven by internal and external factors. Internal Price growth can come from a very strong brand in a less competitive market of slightly inelastic demand. External Price growth feeds from inflationary pressure & is undertaken by all competitors in unison. For example, an increase in Oil prices will lead to rise in transportation costs and it will drive up price of consumer products in a shock wave pattern.3.	Market Growth effects: Riding the growth of Market and economy is a convenient way to increase your revenues. The critical factor is how to time it correctly for which you need access to Market dynamics as outlined in point (2) above.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Companies build products that would create synergy, both through direct and indirect pull-through revenue, across product lines. For example, a company may introduce powerful software that can be offered both as a standalone product and can also be offered in a bundled setting (combining product, service, accessories & consumables). In a product mix category, the software will drive revenue of other products thereby strengthening the product line sales.Commoditization of ProductsRevenue can be increased by increasing price, if the product is superior enough, with no close substitutes and inelastic market demand. Alternatively, revenue can be increased on ad-hoc basis by cutting the list price (discounting) and propping up sales. On the flip side, increased revenue through discounting can hurt margins. This trend characterizes a “commoditized market” where pricing is the primary consideration and not the brand in itself.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

On the other hand, if the firm''s ROA is lower than the interest rate, then its ROE will be lower than if it did not borrow. Leverage allows greater potential returns to the investor than otherwise would have been available. The potential for loss is also greater, because if the investment becomes worthless, the loan principal and all accrued interest on the loan still need to be repaid.A firm''s debt to equity ratio (measured at market value or book value, depending on the purpose of the analysis) is therefore an indication of its leverage. Degree of financial leverage (DFL) may be defined as the percentage change in earnings (Earnings per share) that occurs as a result of a percentage change in earnings before interest and taxes.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

These two functions must make joint efforts to control COPQ as it becomes hard to identify actual source of COPQ. Companies deploy lean six sigma projects across “internal supply chain” to cut COPQ and generate substantial cost savings. Poor quality adds to the routine costs of production. “Operational effectiveness” plays a critical role in enhancing productivity (efficiency) and strengthening operating margins. In a cross-functional setting, business operations and processes need to be effective in different functional areas all across the value chain. Business divisions must design and structure “critical business processes” efficiently to achieve operational effectiveness. More importantly, these “business processes” should focus on timely value creation activities which must be thoroughly documented in specific “Standing Operating Procedures” SOPs. Some companies will not have any defined business processes, and even if they have one, those would remain undocumented. If a business process is not put into a policy document or SOP, people can ignore it inadvertently.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(116, 'Economic Output and Inflation Dynamics, ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar:Money Supply and InflationThere is some evidence of inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation – called as sacrifice ratio. For example, a sacrifice ratio of 5 would mean that you need to sacrifice 5% of GDP to cut inflation rate by 1%.Higher Money growth may increase output in the short run, by lowering interest rates and triggering investments. But this may not happen under all circumstances. For example during the great deleveraging of Japanese economy in the 1990s, firms did not borrow money despite the fact that interest rates were practically zero.In the long run, money is neutral and changes in the money supply translate fully into price increase; and the real variables of the economy remain unchanged.Wage Inflation and economic output gapCan the economy employ all citizens/residents actively seeking work? The answer is no. At some stage in the economy, there is always going to be frictional and structural unemployment. This implies that every economy has a natural unemployment rate called as the Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). The gap between the actual unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate has important implications for the wage inflation.•	When the actual unemployment level is above the NAIRU, there is an excess supply of labor force in the market and it keeps a tab on wage inflation.•	Conversely when the actual unemployment level is below the NAIRU, there is a pressure on companies to seek workers. This gives bargaining power to the labor force and ultimately fuels wage inflation.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(118, 'What determines the level of Interest rates? ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: Higher interest rates and rising level of inflation are generally viewed as bad both for the stocks and the bonds market; and good for the commodities market. Yet there would be some exceptions due to complex Inter-market relations. More importantly, expectations play a very prominent role in the determination of interest as well as inflation rates.Following are key determinants of interest rates:1.	Expectations: Interest rates are built around future expectations. If people have credibility in the functioning of the central bank, they will take actions which keep the interest rates steady.2.	Inflation: Inflation is good for borrowers and bad for lenders. When lenders expect inflation, they will charge higher interest rates.3.	Foreign interest rates: These rates have influence on the domestic rates. For example, if the Canadian dollar is under persistent pressure due to lower rates, in comparison to USD, the Bank of Canada may act to strengthen the Canadian Currency by raising the Bank rate.4.	The central bank can regulate short and long term rates. Pumping money into the economy will trim rates, while tightening the supply will prop up rates. In any case, the bank will not be able to influence the long term rates.5.	Interest rates and risk valuation go hand in gloves. There is always a risk premium on all kinds of rates prevailing in the economy. Lenders will demand greater return in risky situations. An investor will ask for a greater risk premium over a risk free rate when investing, for example, in high risk debentures.6.	The supply and demand of loanable funds play a great role in interest rate determination. For example, government deficit may lead to higher borrowing and consequently an upward pressure on rates. In contrast, easing of money will lower the rates. Similarly, an increase in the savings of government, companies or households may reduce demand and interest rates.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(120, 'Deflation, Soft Landing and Real Interest Rates, ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: It is ironical to note that the real interest rates can stay very high in a deflationary environment despite attempts by central bank to cut rates to 0%. How is this possible? Here is a possible explanation. Look at the following equation: Real Rate = Nominal Rate – Inflation Rate.In the above equation, suppose nominal rates become zero. The central bank cannot cut rates below zero. Deflation (negative inflation) will lead to higher real rates. The corporate sector will not take loans in a deflationary environment and too much of money (and savings) supply will keep the nominal rates capped to zero.Soft Landing is considered as a Holy Grail of Policy-makers. It entails a growth rate good enough to avert economy from landing into recession rate; and an inflation rate appropriate enough to avert high expectations about inflation. In other words, this is position focuses on a balance point on the sacrifice ratio – higher growth comes at the expense of inflation.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(124, 'What are the key determinants of Foreign Exchange rate? ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: FOREX trade is one of the very high growth areas with trillions of dollars of annual trade. In this blog post, I have made an attempt to summarize the key determinants of exchange rate:1.	Purchasing Power Parity: Currencies of countries with lower inflation are expected to appreciate in future. Lower inflation implies lower interest rates and people will invest at lower rates only when they have positive expectations about future.2.	Interest Rate Parity (International Fisher Effect): Put simply, and assuming no transaction costs, it says that the spot and forward prices would entail interest rate differential between the two currencies. Higher domestic rates attract inflow of capital from abroad; lower rates have opposite effects.3.	Current Account: The deficit country would demand more foreign currency. Obviously this exceed demand would create downward pressure on the domestic exchange rate.4.	Terms of Trade: It is simply the ratio of export prices to import prices. If export prices increase by 10% and import prices by 7%, the terms of trade are 3% (positive range). This would reflect greater demand for exports and resultantly upward pressure on domestic currency.5.	Impact of Commodities: Currencies of countries like Canada and Australia are heavily linked to the Commodity prices.6.	Economic Perception: Perception of economic strength of a country gives vitality to its currency as well.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

The Greek crisis is “cultural” insofar that extravagant spending habits developed over a long period of time cannot be changed overnight by invoking austerity measures suddenly. Last but not least, the crisis has economic underpinnings in that any bad news would snow-ball into bunch of “potential debt problems” across Europe. It is not just Greece which is ailing from an ailing fiscal management apparatus – there are many other players in Europe as well.Any unilateral emergency funding by the European Central Bank will partially solve the problem. Ironically, any temporary solution would encourage a degree of “moral hazard” problems in the long haul. A more holistic solution would entail an effective alignment of discipline at two thresholds: effective management of fiscal discipline at national level and enforcement of transparent governance standards by the European Central Bank.

Interest rates are at record low in US, Japan and Europe; while emerging economies are tightening rates to curb potential inflationary pressures. Note arbitrageurs are opportunists who would cash on price disparities existing between similar assets. Carry forward trade envisages borrowing at lower rates and investing (lending) at dearer rates, and pocketing the difference. This activity in most cases would stoke the prices of assets in emerging economies like China, and sometimes results in inflated bubbles of assets.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

The most valid argument is that it overcomes the inherent conflict of interest built onto the commission based system.

Similarly, a Financial Advisor may discourage the client to move his or her money from its current investment status, in the hope of not losing the trailer fees etc. In conclusion, the Asset Management fees and commission should not be anchored to specific product structure but should be based on efficient management of assets.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(149, 'Key Difference between Mutual Funds and Segregated Funds, ', 'One key difference between Segregated Funds and Mutual Funds lies in the method of distribution by Trusts/Corporations which hold these assets. While Mutual Funds distribute capital gains in the form of dividends and interest income accrued from fixed investments; the Segregated Funds, which are Insurance contracts, go a step further to distribute both capital gains and capital losses. From this perspective, it is more beneficial to hold Segregated funds in your Portfolio-in so far you can apply capital losses to future capital gains and therefore optimize your tax liability.In Canada, dividends distribution is considered as capital gains in case of Mutual funds. This is an advantage because capital gains are taxed at 50% in Canada. If dividends are reinvested, they increase the Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) by that amount – this would minimize taxable gains in future. Thus dividend is simply a distribution of capital gain. 50% of net Capital gains is added to the investor income and taxed at their Marginal tax rate. Capital losses are not distributed in Mutual Fund distributions. However it is done in case of Segregated funds.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(153, 'Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Stock Valuation, ', 'What is the discount rate for a risky project? For risk free projects, it is the risk free rate of interest – normally those offered by the Treasury bills. You need to add premium to the risk-free rate to discount risky projects and investments. For example, stock investments are more risky than Treasury bills and would require a greater return on investments. This difference between the required return on stocks and risk-free rate is called as “Equity Risk Premium”.CAPM theory states in simple words that while a diversified portfolio can eliminate company-specific risks, it cannot eliminate equity market risk. The latter measure of risk is approximated by Beta – which is sensitivity of stock price to the overall changes in the stock market (and of course the macro-economy). For example, a stock with beta of 1.0 would move in line with the equity market; one with beta greater than 1.0 is more sensitive to market movements; and one with beta less than 1.0 is relatively less sensitive. Treasury bills should have a zero beta value.In nutshell, CAPM suggests that the required return on a stock is equal to the risk free rate plus beta multiplied by the prevailing equity risk premium. Higher the risk (beta), higher would be the required return expected by the investors. DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(155, 'Why two stocks with the same Beta can have different returns? ', ' Under CAPM, a single beta is used as a proxy to the Market equity risk. In the real world, this is not the case because market risk can span across a spectrum of risks like Interest rate risk, inflation risk, exchange rate risk and so on. For example, there could be 4-7 betas, each defined by a specific market risk. These betas are driven by pertinent Macroeconomic factors. The overall risk will be the summation of these specific risks. The Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) attempts to capture these detailed factors in order to better explain/qualify the CAPM Model.One shortcoming of APT is that it does not pin down specific Macroeconomic factors. An analyst still needs to deploy relevant factors and customize the APT model. Remember that the fundamental value of a company is based on discounted cash flows in the form of expected dividends. Therefore we need to identify pertinent macroeconomic factors that can affect expected future dividends of a company.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(157, 'The Value Maximizing level of Debt (Optimal leverage) ', ' Leverage (a possible proxy for corporate risk) can be defined as the ratio of liabilities to assets; or the ratio of debt to total capital (debt plus equity). Leverage is a double-edged sword, because it can magnify both returns and losses. Companies typically aim to achieve rate of return on projects that would exceed the cost of borrowing – thereby generating Value creation. More importantly, all this will happen from relatively cheaper before-tax dollars (interest payments on debt are tax deductible). The perception of Market stays positive in raising debt as long as the Debt to Equity ratio looks reasonable. In contrast, raising equity is more costly as dividends in most countries are not tax deductible. Modigliani and Merton in their MM Theory pointed out: “a world with no taxes, perfect and credible disclosure of all information, and no transactions costs associated with raising money or going bankrupt – the extent of debt in a company’s capital structure does not affect the firm value.” However there is no free lunch and this theory will not hold in the practical world. This is because there are diminishing marginal returns to increasing leverage (until we reach the optimal level of debt). What leads to such diminished marginal returns on debt?•	As debt burden increases, the marginal increase of shielded income decreases.•	Potential risks of bankruptcy raise red flags. Bankruptcy can have serious transaction costs, lawyer fees and drag on intangibles of the company.•	Highly indebted companies are more vulnerable to economic swings.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(161, 'Which is a better measure of Stock Performance – Earnings vs. Cash Flows? ', 'There has been a debate whether Earnings or Cash flows represent a better assessment of a stock’s value? While the Cash Flow measures inflows and outflows within a specific time period; Earnings would measure net flows accrued from an operating cycle. The advantage of using Earnings as a Valuation measure is a better understanding of “repetitive operations” of the Company; and this will lead to a better handle on projecting the forecasted earnings of the company. On the other hand, Cash Flows are merely receipts and payments and it becomes hard to make future predictions about the value of stock based on this piece of information alone.The disadvantage of using Earnings as a yardstick of performance is on account of “discretionary accounting decisions” exercised by the management. For example, the management can take decisions to speed up revenue recognition or slow down expense recognition. Also there is a great degree of flexibility in recognition (amortization) of non-recurring events. These accounting gimmicks, if not checked internally & audited externally, can become a problem and in some cases not allow correct assessment of current and future earning capacity of a company. In contrast, Cash Flows estimation is a credible measure of a Company’s current performance. This is the core “Stock Valuation Conundrum” – Cash Flow valuation is credible but not relevant; Earnings valuation is relevant but not credible! It is therefore recommended to analyze Earnings in tandem with Cash Flows and point out any discrepancies between them. Any serious mismatch between the two should be viewed as a potential red-flag!DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

On the flip side, pledges against specific assets may come at the cost of flexibility needed for M&As, restructuring etc.Debentures are not secured by specific pledges or liens; offer relatively higher coupon as compared to Bonds. Higher risk translates into higher coupon.Preferred Shares are relatively expensive because of fixed nature of dividends paid from after tax earnings. Preferred Shares have preference over stocks in terms of dividends and redemptions. They normally do not have voting rights for the Shareholders. The advantage of issuing Preferred Stocks is that is does not disturb Debt to Equity ratio. Non-payment of fixed dividends is little difficult, though it does happen sometimes. In that case, investors are compensated through grant of voting rights. One disadvantage is that the Purchase Fund, meant to redeem preferred, can be an additional cost to the company.Common Shares are both risky and attractive option to investors. Large cap blue-chip companies pay dividends while mid-cap growth companies are attractive investments from the standpoint of potential capital appreciation.

(181, 'Stop Loss Order vs. Stop Buy Order ', ' Stop Loss Orders aim to protect the free fall of a declining security – thus limiting the loss or protecting the profit. On a rising trend, it is better to have a trailing stop loss order. More importantly, stop loss orders should be at a certain distance from the market price level in order to avoid execution by a choppy market. In contrast, Stop Buy Orders are applicable in the context of shorting stocks. You instruct your broker to buy a stock after it reaches certain price level. Again if the stock is moving down, it is appropriate to have trailing stop buy orders.The following example will clarify the above point:I purchase a stock at $10 and in a month’s time it rises to $15. I want to lock my profit now. I will ask my broker to place a stop loss order at $13 (some distance below the current price). Suppose the stock next moves to $20. I will ask my broker to shift the stop loss order to $17. In other words, I have put a trailing stop loss order at some distance (typically this distance can be 10-15% of the change in price level).Suppose I shorted a stock at $20 and hope that it will decrease in price. The stock slides to $15. I am nervous that the stock may not rise back to $20 or go beyond it. I would ask my broker to put a stop buy order at $17 just above $15. If the stock declines further to $13, I will trail the stop buy order to $15. Just to refresh the memory of readers, stop buy order is applicable when we short stocks. Shorting is a process whereby you would borrow stocks from your broker and sell them in market with the hope to buy back those stocks at a lower price level. The risk is an unexpected increase in the price of stock. Regardless of the price of shorted stocks, the investor is bound to return the borrowed stocks to the broker. If the stock price declines, the short will gain profit; conversely if the price goes up, the short will lose money.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(185, 'Business Cycles and Contrarian Investing ', ' Fluctuations in output and unemployment are called as Business Cycles. There are five distinct phases of Business Cycle as explained below. The important point to underscore is that the stock market is a leading indicator of the performance of the economy; yet it is extremely difficult to anticipate correctly the timing of business cycles in the real world.Trough: Ensuing recession, due to dampened demand and excess capacity, keeps inflation under control. Interest rates are very low. Falling prices and lower interest rates stimulate demand to some extent. As well as stocks begin to rally. From the standpoint of Contrarians, this would be a good time to start making investments in the stock market.Recovery: Interest rates are low and prices may fall a bit; due to excess capacity already existing. Firms and households begin purchase of consumer items; and some activity is seen in the stock market.Expansion: As demand grows, businesses adjust their inventories; and begin to make new capital investments. Real GDP grows and there is anticipation of inflation & high interest rates.Peak: The demand outstrips capacity; interest rates increase; and inflation rises. This results in halt on business activity and stock prices begin to slow down. It is because of this reason that the Contrarians will always advise to short stocks before the economy reaches the peak.Contraction: As the economy cools down, the supply exceeds demand and inventories begin to pile up. Customers cut down on expenditure and focus on savings. Central Banks step forward to cut interest rates. Unemployment worsens.

Start increasing your exposure to stocks in the Bear Market – in particular when the S&P 500 Index is trading at 5-10% below its 200 days Moving Average.2.	Start reducing your exposure in the Bull Market – in particular when the S&P 500 Index moves 5-10% above its 200 day Moving Average.Remember there are always time-lags in making such assessments.

(214, 'Risks of Putin’s Economic Policy for Russia, ', ' \nThe Russian economy is underpinned by the emerging growth of global oil demand, coming mainly from BRIC. This mega trend assumed growth momentum during the decade 1998-2000. Putin and his government unleashed privatization of Oil Industry in order to spur growth and ride the wave of rising global demand for oil.  However this policy was designed under the ambit of State control. In Russia, state plays vital role to control and shape Oil Industry which accounts for 30-40% of GDP. \nThe major challenges of the next decade entail substantial risks to the growth momentum witnessed by Russia in the past decade:\n(1)-Russia has not been able to keep pace with technological advancements undertaken by the US and other countries.

(215, 'The Breakout Economies of the next decade, ', ' Most economists are making hyped predictions about across-the-board growth of BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) through 2050. The common prediction is that the next century is poised to bring “Asian greatness”; and East will rise again in its glory which existed many centuries back. The general trends of the decade preceding the 2008-2009 financial crisis, point toward some degree of “convergence” trend showing that the emerging economies (BRIC in particular) are catching up fast with the developed economies. This momentum may not continue with the same thrust as predicted by vast majority of economic and financial analysts due to the following reasons:(1)-The World economy and the stock markets are highly globalized and integrated. At the best, the general trend will be sluggish growth, due to emerging Sovereign debt crisis, and sideways markets. This trend will keep under check the growth of most emerging economies.(2)-The growth of BRIC economies is driven by divergent factors. For example Brazil and Russia are exporters of energy (Oil, Gas) while China boosts its growth from exports to Europe and the US. India is mainly exporter of Information Technology. The trends witnessed during the decade of great growth 1998-2008 may not repeat. For example, Chinese exports may decline due to cooling economies of Europe; the Oil exporting economies of Russia and Brazil might find hard time due to rising costs and lowering price (profits); and India may face some shift of its Information Technology exports to Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. (3)-The predictions for time period exceeding ten years are like fairy tales. It is not possible to make good predictions beyond one business cycle, typically five years or two business cycles at the most. Reports like Global Trends 2050 are less realistic.(4)-Some breakout economies with promising track-record, often ignored by economists, may show double-digit growth in the next decade: Nigeria, Bangladesh, South Korea, Czech Republic, Poland, Thailand and Philippines.Overall, the growth of emerging economies will be uneven, unpredictable and in line with key macroeconomic trends; deviating substantially from the current predictions of majority of economists and financial analysts.

Learn from the history of Stocks and Bonds because: “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it (George Santayana)”. High investment returns cannot be earned without taking substantial risk. Safe investments produce lower returns. As markets are becoming more volatile and unpredictable, the quest for higher returns is coming at the cost of higher risks only.Good companies are generally bad stocks and bad companies are generally good stocks. On a similar note, when the political and economic outlook is positive, returns are relatively lower. Intuitively, when things look gloomy, the returns could potentially be at the highest level. This is because in a period of uncertainty, investors discount future stock income at a higher rate. This would results into lower stock prices with higher expected future returns. Counter-intuitively, when economic environment is optimistic, it is not feasible to invest; because future income is discounted at lower rates (lower perceived risks). This results into higher stock prices and lower expected returns.Recall that according to Gordon equation: Market Return=Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth. The drivers of dividend yield and dividend growth is corporate earnings (both quality and growth of earnings). Over the long term, if the annualized earnings growth rate is about 7%, then the stock price (on annualized basis) should trail this number as well.For bonds, the expected return in the long run is simply its coupon or interest payments. Typically the coupon rate will not change. There is an additional caveat though. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds decline; but the rate at which the interest is reinvested will rise partially offsetting the decline in the value of bonds. In nutshell, the long term bond returns will dovetail the coupon rate.The fundamental return of the Stock Market (Gordon equation) – the sum of long term dividend growth and dividend yield – are somewhat predictable in the long run. However the short term movement driven by volatility and speculation cannot be predicted. There are three “time-bound” drivers of stock prices: dividends in the short term and P/E multiples for short term speculation. For the long term stock value and growth, it is all about dividend growth (indirectly driven by the corporate earnings) from the Gordon equation. In other words, it is possible to predict long term trend of stock market based on Gordon equation to quite an extent; but not possible to make short term predictions due to high degree of volatility and speculations (noise).When the discount rate goes up, the stock prices go down. Higher discount rate implies higher anticipated risk and returns and therefore lower price. In fact, some bad companies can show excellent temporary performance. Tom Peters in his book “In Search of Excellence” demonstrated that the un-excellent companies excelled the excellent companies by a stunning 11% margin per year.Past superior performance has no guarantees for future performance. The capital markets are ruthlessly efficient. Stock picking and timing markets are very costly mistakes. Because there are so many money managers analyzing stocks, their collective wisdom is reflected instantaneously in the stock prices. Thus stock prices behave random and unpredictable. This concept is known as EMH-Efficient Market Hypothesis. Fama was one of its proponents. One example of existence of EMH is that Value Line has not been able to beat the Market Index.Professional Asset Management is a very tough business. Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch are the only two managers who have shown solid evidence of skill. Other managers excelled for a short while and then went into oblivion.Mutual Funds costs are bad news for the investors. There are four key costs of Mutual Funds:(A)-The funds Expense ratio (MER) which is listed in the Prospectus and Annual Statements.(B)-The fund’s Advisory Fees, administrative expenses and commissions paid on transactions. These costs are imbued in such a way that it becomes very difficult to identify how these costs would eat into the returns on these funds.(C)-Bid-Ask Spread: This is the difference between the higher purchase price and lower sale price. The Bid-Ask spread increases with decreasing size of Company.(D)-Finally the impact and rebalancing costs; accrued from external Macroeconomic environment which imbalance the asset allocation strategy and misaligns the composition of Portfolio and its risk matrix.The key driver of a perfect Portfolio is Asset Allocation – built around diversification. The asset allocation is also a function of your risk tolerance and tracking error. Investing in one stock can be quite risky. Your overall asset allocation is determined by your objective, risk tolerance, time horizon and tax situation.Finance is purely behavioral as pointed out by many economists. Greed and Fear will rule investor behavior for all times to come. Most important of all, when investors are pessimist, there is greater expected return in future and vice versa.The major behavior mistakes do not let us achieve our investment goals: limiting beliefs, myopic vision, biases, reliance on patterns, irrational exuberance, herd mentality, the great company illusion, inconsistency and timing the market.It is difficult and counter-productive to clone smart money managers for two reasons: Past good performers sometimes tank; while laggards could potentially perform quite well in future. Second, stellar performance trails funds accumulation from all sources; which ultimately increases exposure to impact costs and misalignment of Portfolio to risk profile. For example, Peter Lynch, the greatest Mutual Funds Manager of all times witnessed diminishing returns of his funds as he scaled up the size of funds and volume of transactions.Start your retirement planning today. Divide your savings into two categories: the long term retirement account invested in a well diversified Portfolio; and a taxable account to meet any financial emergency. This taxable account should normally contain six months of your income to weather any unforeseen liquidity risks. In addition, to this you must also have adequate life and disability insurance.“Survivorship Bias” is a major cause of overstated Performance of Funds. Simply put it is about focusing on short term period when the funds have performed quite well. Some Fund Managers (and Funds) perform well in the short run but if you factor in the long run performance, these funds record below average returns. It is absolutely important to take into account long term performance of the fund and not rely on short term victories, which generally reverse over the long haul.To conclude, using the above principles you can design your own KISS (Keep it simple and sensible) Portfolio with better performance and less costs than most funds. Remember the real value add will come from disciplining your emotions, rebalancing the Portfolio and staying the course.', 1, '2013-01-19 21:14:27', '2014-03-24 23:40:31', 1);

The roller coaster ride of the US fiscal policy produced more volatility in the capital markets than   the disappointing data coming from Europe and Japan.2. The European Economies (and the housing market) are in recession except for Germany. The European banks are tightening the credit to consumers. This will dampen the consumer spending and lead to decline in the GDP.3. Japan continues to struggle with over two decades of deflation (inflation in the negative zone). Japan plans to pump more money into the economy to trigger some inflation. This strategy will devalue yen indirectly and boost exports.4. Despite fiscal sequestration issues masking the US fiscal scene, the key fundamentals of the US economy are not bad at all. Both the housing and labor markets are rebounding back a bit and it is hoped that these markets will pick further momentum in 2013.5. The Canadian housing market is facing a downturn. The situation is further exacerbated by weakening of economic growth around 1%. The 30% contraction in the housing starts in Q4 2012 does not augur well for the housing health in 2013.

Second, stellar performance trails funds accumulation from all sources; which ultimately increases exposure to impact costs and misalignment of Portfolio to risk profile. For example, Peter Lynch, the greatest Mutual Funds Manager of all times witnessed diminishing returns of his funds as he scaled up the size of funds and volume of transactions.\nStart your retirement planning today. Divide your savings into two categories: the long term retirement account invested in a well diversified Portfolio; and a taxable account to meet any financial emergency. This taxable account should normally contain six months of your income to weather any unforeseen liquidity risks. In addition, to this you must also have adequate life and disability insurance.\n“Survivorship Bias” is a major cause of overstated Performance of Funds. Simply put it is about focusing on short term period when the funds have performed quite well. Some Fund Managers (and Funds) perform well in the short run but if you factor in the long run performance, these funds record below average returns. It is absolutely important to take into account long term performance of the fund and not rely on short term victories, which generally reverse over the long haul.\nTo conclude, using the above principles you can design your own KISS (Keep it simple and sensible) Portfolio with better performance and less costs than most funds. Remember the real value add will come from disciplining your emotions, rebalancing the Portfolio and staying the course.\n', 1, '2013-01-22 03:19:28', '2013-01-22 03:19:28', 0);

(271, 'Articles ', '<strong>The Macro-dynamics of the US and the Canadian Housing Markets: An Analytical Comparison, </strong><strong>Introduction:</strong>This paper examines three key fundamental questions: (1)-Would the US housing market face any reversal given what is happening in the US and global economy? (2)-As predicted by some pundits, would the Canadian economy undergo any serious correction? (3)-What are the key macroeconomic factors which impact the Canadian and the US housing markets? And using this framework what predictions can we make both for short and long term trends of real estate markets?<strong>The US Housing Market: Its Evolution from Crisis (2007-2008) to Present:</strong>The US housing bubble was created by “Steroids Banking” using “Securitization” process and taking advantage of low interest rates and massive inflow of investment money from abroad. The housing prices in most regions almost doubled 2001 to 2006; and subprime lending escalated astronomically. The private Mortgage banks were applying their creativity and greed in designing highly risky esoteric mortgage products using the “Securitization” process.What is “Securitization”? Put simply this is packaging of mortgages (including subprime) into structured products (Mortgage backed securities, Collateralized debt obligations). The manufacturing mortgage bank then removes these esoteric products from its balance sheets to minimize any risks and sells these products to institutional investors using SIV (Structured investment vehicles). The buyers of these products erroneously assumed that the underlying mortgages of these securities were “safe collateral” given upward trending housing market. However, when subprime mortgages defaulted and housing market began to sink, these structured products built around defaulting mortgages fell sharply in value, thereby freezing the entire global credit system. Added to this turmoil was dilution of commercial paper because of potential default of big lending institutions. The global financial system was under siege. Ironically, the Credit default swaps, which mean to insure against default of these mortgages collapsed under their own weight, thereby reinforcing the Credit crisis. The US Treasury and the Fed intervened and injected trillions of dollars to save the collapsing US Housing and Banking system.This crisis is a classic example of “Moral Hazard” issue. Who was responsible for over-leveraging the system beyond its buoyancy point? Technically the Mortgage banks had packaged the mortgages and passed on the risks to the institutional investors. The institutional investors made the wrong assumption that the US housing market will move North forever. The Fed and other institutions did not have a proper regulatory-monitoring structure as envisioned in the BASEL guidelines to avert such over-leveraging. Nobody knew who will be responsible if the edifice collapses. Worst of all, the institutional investors assumed wrongly that the “Credit default swaps” (CDS) instruments would work miracles; and bail out defaulting mortgages. This is known as Moral hazard problem. Ultimately everybody was looking forward to the Fed and the Treasury to bail out the global financial system from reaching the doomsday.<strong>The US Housing Market in the aftermath of Crisis:</strong>The “Mortgage Delinquency Rate (MDR)” is a key metric that speaks of the real fallout of the US housing crisis (2007-2008). It measures the percentage change in delinquency of residential loans. In June 2007, the MDR was 2.17% and reached its highest level in March 2011 at 11.36%. It recovered back to 2008 levels at 10.4% recently. MDR is a key lagging indicator that reflects economic difficulties. Another key metric reflecting the state of housing health in the US is the S&amp;P/Case Shiller Home Price Index. This is an index reflecting change in housing prices of 20 (and 10) key US metropolitan areas. The home prices in April 2012 for 20-city composite have reached the level existing in the start of 2003. In April 2012, the home prices have declined about 34-35% from its peak level in 2006.The main reason for a stagnant US housing market as evidenced from the MDR data is a fragile labor market. Slow job growth rate is due to weak consumer spending, which is the 70% component of real GDP and key driver of job creation in the US. Consumer spending is directly related to job growth rate, the saving rate and the consumer confidence. In an uncertain environment, spending falls and both the US dollar and saving rate increases. Although savings are recycled by the intermediaries as investments for businesses, this does not necessarily translate onto investment spending and GDP growth. Companies in a high risk environment aim to trim their balance sheets by paying off their debts, a process called as deleveraging. They do not want to burden their balance sheets by borrowing from banks. This deleveraging process slows down the level of investment in the economy thereby indirectly moderating the job growth rate. Deleveraging also runs counterproductive to low interest rates and impedes growth in jobs and therefore fast recovery of real estate prices.<strong>Why the Canadian housing market is not poised for a serious correction?</strong>The Canadian Mortgage system is more robust and conservative than the one prevailing in the US. First of all, the Canadian subprime market is only 5% of total outstanding mortgages whereas during its peak years 2004-2006, the US subprime market captured 25% of total outstanding US mortgages. The Canadian mortgage system executes better risk management tools including limited exposure to securitization and tight lending practices backed by insurance mortgage. The recent changes in the Mortgage lending have further tightened the belts to avoid any risks to healthy housing in Canada.The supply and demand conditions in Canada are monitored by all players actively. There is a great degree of transparency and authenticity in the housing data and practices. Supply dovetails both current and future demand leaving little room for creation of bubbles. Remember bubbles happen when there is a huge undiscovered lag between supply and demand. For example, there is an anticipated constraint of commercial real estate supply in the wake of surging demand both in Toronto area and Western Canada.A large number of Canadians are currently disillusioned by lower and volatile investment returns in the core financial assets, stocks and bonds. The ongoing volatility in the Capital markets is expected to last in the next few years, given some long lasting problems like risks of Sovereign debt crisis in Europe &amp; the US. This situation has mobilized a great number of people to invest in real estate as most viable alternative investment in the wake of record low interest rates. This process might continue for some years as the core financial assets (stocks, bonds and mutual funds) may not pick up momentum soon.The concept of a bubble is not quite relevant in the context of the Canadian housing market. This is explained in terms of a typical sales cycle witnessed in Toronto and other places in Canada. The sales cycle woven around tighter demand-supply conditions mitigates the probability of bubbles. For example, in Toronto, condos are sold or flipped by investors, who generally do not live in those condos. When interest rates would inch up in future, these investors will find it difficult to keep highly expensive condos. They will sell these condos putting downward pressure on prices of the condominium market. Intuitively, the falling prices will give opportunity to new immigrants and other investors to purchase condos, as they could not previously afford it. This process is further strengthened by different ethnic groups who support their new immigrant friends and families toward the purchase of their first homes in Canada. Overall these processes would push prices upwards again. To conclude, given these tight supply-demand conditions, the chances of any serious correction are quite minimal in Toronto.<strong>What are the Macroeconomic factors which impact the prices of Real Estate?</strong>Interest Rates and Inflation: Interest rate is the price of money. It is determined by supply and demand of loanable funds. However the country’s Central bank can greatly influence the rate by tightening credit conditions or making those relaxed by pumping money into the system. This is typically done through Monetary Policy and open Market operations. Lower rates make it cheaper for potential buyers to borrow money and make purchases. It also helps current homeowners to refinance their homes and save money. All this will lead to stronger demand for mortgages and housing. Increasing rates will have the opposite effect and dampen the level of sales activity in the Mortgage market.Carry forward trades, borrowing at lower rates in one region and investing it in other, also indirectly impact real estate. For example, foreign institutional investors can borrow money overseas at cheaper rates and invest in Canadian real estate market. More important, real interest rates equal nominal rates minus inflation. Rising level of inflation will lower the real interest rates and declining levels will inflate real rates. Inflation typically feeds into asset prices including real estate. Tightening of money supply is done to control inflation, and this process leads to rising interest rates. Easing of money supply is done to trigger growth and this is accompanied with declining interest rates. However greater supply of money and rising oil prices (supply side) feed into inflation and ultimately inflates asset prices.Economic Growth, Consumer spending and Employment level: Economic growth is measured by growth in the real GDP. Slowdown in economic growth-both global and regional-raises fears of “deflation” or declining prices, which does not bode well with overall economic affluence. Deflation can be compared to freezing of an economy. Japan experienced sustained recession due to deflation for a long period. Fear of deflation due to declining growth can have negative impact on the real estate market.Labor Market dynamics and in particular the level of unemployment has a critical relationship to the health of the housing sector. Rising unemployment during recession is often accompanied with low housing demand and mortgage delinquencies. For example, when Enron crisis erupted, there was general softening in the regional housing market. Another example is the current state of the US housing market. Economists say that the slow pace of housing recovery is attributed to a stagnant US labor market, which is stuck up at over 8% of unemployment rate.Consumer spending plays a key role in the US while the export sector plays an important role in China. As well in Canada, consumer spending has correlation to the GDP growth. In case of the US, Consumer spending constitutes 70% of GDP and is therefore most important driver of GDP growth rate. Higher consumption level, driven by consumer confidence levels, leads to greater economic (job creation) activity and ultimately translates into greater demand for housing. Surging consumer debt, as it is happening in Canada, is also not healthy for a sustainable consumption and GDP growth. Over-leveraged consumers do not have the capacity to absorb shocks like layoffs or increase in interest rates &amp; inflation.Institutional Capacity of Economy to absorb External shocks: The housing crisis of 2007-2008 contaminated the global financial system. The Fed and G-7 countries had to undertake unprecedented bail out measures to save the global financial system from getting derailed. Fortunately, the Canadian housing market was resilient enough to absorb the shocks and did not sink. This happened because of a relatively conservative mortgage system prevailing in Canada. Regulatory measures also impact the resilience of the housing market. For example, tax credits in the US had triggered growth of the housing sector in the aftermath of crisis. Canada has applied its regulations to keep the housing sector strong and healthy.Demographics and Migration: These play an important role in shaping the long term prospects of the real estate market. In Canada and the US, the aging population of baby boomers will create more demand for residential and vacation homes in the next decade. International migration to Canada is also an important determinant of housing market in Canada.Technology, Oil-Commodities boom and Exports: The Canadian economic and housing activity is also impacted by three external forces: Chinese Investors, Oil-commodities prices and economic activity in the US. The Western Canada is impacted by the level of Chinese and foreign investments, mainly in the Mining and Oil sector. The Eastern region, mainly Ontario and Quebec, is impacted by the level of exports to the US and therefore indirectly on the state of the US economy. Stronger Canadian dollar does not augur well for exporters. Overall, the Canadian economy and dollar are strengthened by rising demand for Oil and commodities.National Level of debt: In the US, the national level of debt is reaching about $14 trillion and will continue to grow in the years to come. National debt piles up due to persistent fiscal deficits in the economy. In the US, there is a challenge of twin deficits-both fiscal deficit and external imbalances. The twin deficits not only lead to faster growth of national debt but trigger anticipation of higher interest rates and inflation. This happens through the following mechanism: Higher debt in the US is monetized by either selling bonds to China (or other surplus countries) or by printing money from thin air. In either case it leads to greater risks and consequently higher interest rates, fast depreciating currencies and therefore more inflation. Some economists say that if debt is not contained by the US policy-makers, we may enter an era of hyperinflation where all asset prices (including real estate) will become very costly.<strong>Applying Macroeconomic Framework to analyze current &amp; future trends:</strong>(I)-Current Global Economic Outlook: The global economic growth is expected to moderate in 2012 (and perhaps 2013). Concomitantly, the global real estate market is cooling down a bit. The moderation in growth is spread unequally across different geographical regions. In the US, which been the central point of housing crisis, there is some improvement in key housing indicators. Given sustained low rates, minimal probability of deflation (freezing of economy) and complete preparations by European Central Bank to cope with Eurozone debt crisis-there is less likelihood of any major reversal to the US economic fundamentals and therefore the housing market.The key emerging Global housing trends are captured in the following summary:(A)-The battered US housing market is relatively stable, with less increase in foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies. The US market is currently an ideal buyers’ market. However, there will be a substantial lag time before we can witness a complete turnaround in the US housing market.(B)-The vibrant Canadian housing market is generally perceived to be ready for some correction in 2012 and 2013. Chart V shows key housing trends in Canada.(C)-The European housing market is (and will in future) undergoing a degree of correction. This stems from recent fiscal crisis in Europe as well as fragility of the German economy exposed recently. The housing market in the emerging global economies is also cooling down a bit.(II)-Some Predictions using the Macroeconomic Framework:The short term perspective of the Canadian housing market might witness come corrections in 2012 and 2013, but as argued in this paper this will be minimal. Also, as argued further, the commercial real estate market will stay steady and strong in 2012 and 2013 in Canada.Given the complex interplay of global economic forces and what is happening in the Eurozone and the US in terms of debt crisis, it is rather difficult to make any certain long term predictions. However, growing complexity warrants a more holistic inter-market analysis to predict about the real estate trends. The seven key global economic trends of the next decade can help us understand the future real estate prospects as well. These seven trends are as follows: (1)-The bubble of Sovereign debt crisis in the US and Europe will last for sometimes, at least next decade. Governments in this part of the world are running unsustainable massive debts, which will ultimately put an upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. (2)-The clear outcome of (1) above will be depreciating value of currencies. (3)-Another consequence of (1) above will be fragile and volatile bonds and stock markets. (4)-Commodities, gold and some alternative investments will become attractive as they will be perceived to store real value. Currencies, stocks and bonds will depreciate fast. (5)-Inflation will be triggered by massive monetization of debt (printing currency from thin air). This situation may be exacerbated if China pulls out trillion of dollars of US bond purchases it made in the last decade; and if oil prices continue to move north. (6)-Demographic trends entail growth of baby boomers in North America and Europe leading to migration to North America. (7)-The US dollar will not evaporate because of spectacular performance of the US companies and technological advancement in North America.Given these seven key economic trends of the next decade, the housing market will stay vibrant and steady in Canada and the US. Baby boomers, foreign investors and immigrants will continue to play a critical role in strengthening the housing demand in North America. Hyperinflation, as worst case scenario, might pull down demand of assets because it would stoke prices of those assets including real estate. At this stage, however, it cannot be predicted whether the European and the US governments will take concrete measures to contain their debts and put in place sustainable debt management policies. Future events will unravel the political commitment of these governments. At this stage, one thing is certain: the current debt monetization policy of these governments is not sustainable in the long run.<strong>The Next Great Economic Challenge: Burgeoning Sovereign Debt Crisis Of “Advanced Economies”, </strong>This brief article examines the fundamental question: what are the causes of burgeoning Sovereign debt of advanced economies? And what are the implications of this development for the global economy?<strong>Causes of escalating debt of Advanced Economies</strong>The G-7 public debt as a percentage of GDP has increased consistently since 1977. It is important to note that the gross public debt or net public debt is not meaningful without being analyzed in the context of the Gross domestic product (GDP). The logic behind this metric is simple: if a country could double its GDP, the net effect of doubling its debt will be zero. This concept works similar to that of leverage in the equities market, which is considered as a double-edged sword. If the value of equity increases, profits are magnified using leverage. Conversely, if the value of equity declines, losses are amplified too. On a similar note, if a country can produce GDP at a rate faster that the rate of its debt accumulation, the country can build substantial capacity to absorb additional debt without thwarting its growth prospects.The main causes of debt escalation in the advanced economies are as follows:1. Fiscal stimulus packages in the aftermath of economic crisis of 2008. In particular, the US stimulus packages have been of unprecedented magnitude, which have increased the US national debt manifold.2. Nationalization of private debts of giant private banks, from Merrill Lynch to Citigroup.3. Incapacity of government to levy taxes and raise revenues. Overall, the above three factors have led to increased debt burdens acquired by the advanced economies.4. Aging population will put additional strain on the fiscal health of the advanced economies.<strong>Comparative analysis of Debt sustainability: Advanced vs. Emerging Economies</strong>Analyzing the data of the IMF World Economic Outlook (Sep 2011), gross general Government debt as percent of GDP increased from 72.7% in 2000 to 79.9% in 2008 (the forecasts for 2016 are 108.2%). For G-7 advanced economies, gross general government debt as percent of GDP increased from 77.5% in 2000 to 90.3% in 2009 (the forecasts are 127.4%). The same numbers for the emerging and developing economies are 48.5% in 2000 to 32.5% in 2008 (with forecast of decline to 29.2% in 2016). This shows clearly that the debt levels have declined consistently in the emerging and developing countries.<strong>The Economics of Sovereign Debt Accumulation and Inflation</strong>Inflation is generally considered good for debtors, who would find it convenient to pay loans with cheaper dollars in future. But the bad news is that as money is pumped into the economy, inflation does not rise immediately and uniformly. Prices spread gradually across different sectors. Worst of all, it looks that these sectors are booming. But the temporary booms are adjusted with output contraction and the final result is escalation of price level. The current strategy of money supply as practiced in the US and Euro-zone to an extent, aiming to keep the interest rates low, will inflate these economies in near future. Fractional reserve banking will simply magnify this impact. Rising prices lead to massive depreciation of currencies, thereby creating misallocation of resources and economic inefficiencies. Governments have a tendency to acquire high levels of debt, unlike the private sector due to the following key factors:1. Government can impose taxes on public to raise revenue and pay off interest on debts. The private sector does not generally have such capacity to raise revenue painlessly.2. In case of Public debt, there is no precise metric (For example, debt at 60% of GDP) which could signal precisely what is going to happen in future (or raise red flags). Public debt has many caveats attached to it. It is rather difficult to simplify “public debt as percent of GDP”. In contrast, it is pretty simple to use “debt to income” ratio for private individuals and companies. The Public debt analysis is arbitrary to an extent as explained above; while the Private debt is built around tight accounting principles.3. There is no international bankruptcy court or adjudication body to enforce legal contracts of national debt. It is in the interest of the governments not to default, as it can have serious political backlash. Also potential default would lead to downgrading of bonds by credit rating agencies, which would imply more expensive debt in future.4. There is some degree of Moral Hazard issues attached to Public debt, both in the advanced as well as emerging economies. What is Moral Hazard? It is a tendency by a party to take risks because the costs of any failure will not be borne by that party. For advanced economies, as happened during the economic crisis of 2008, the private banks and organizations indulge in irresponsible financial practices in the hope that they will be bailed out by the Government and Central Banks in the US, China and Europe.For emerging economies, Moral Hazard problem assumes different dimension. It is the government per se which resorts to Moral Hazard along with the private sector institutions. They take on massive debts without efficient utilization of money thereby inflating the economy (commonly called as Dutch disease). They foster hopes that the International development institutions like Asian Development Bank, IMF and World Bank will come to the rescue in case of potential default using tools like “Structural Adjustment Programs.”Implications of Over-indebtedness of Advanced economiesFor the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) countries, the current debt situation is not sustainable. The recipe of austerity measures, apart from creating political backlash; acts as a countervailing force to monetary policy stimulus. This is because “austerity” entails cutting down on development expenditure and possibly increasing taxes. Given below full employment level of economy, as is the case for the Euro-zone currently, the current austerity measures will lead to further contraction of the economy. The paradox of “Euro-zone Austerity” measures is that these will choke growth and push the economy on a long term recessionary spiral path.In contrast, the US economy is much more “resilient” than the Euro-zone because of the following three key reasons: (A)-the US dollar remains as the international reserve currency; which not only makes US dollar as safe haven currency but also gives ability to the US government to borrow at lower interest rate; (B)-the fundamentals of the US economy are stronger than the Euro-zone individual economies; (C)-the innovation and productivity of the US economy is a very strong intangible, which will continue to add strength to the US dollar in the foreseeable future. However, the US growth might slow down in the short run because of the falling external demand (Europe in particular) for exports.Finally, if we make an analytical comparison between advanced and emerging economies, the probability of growth (accompanied with less debt burden) is much higher in the emerging economies than the advanced ones. The logical implication is that the emerging economies will most probably finance the deficits and growth of the advanced economies in the next decade.To conclude, the next economic crisis of Sovereign debt has already started. Perhaps it will not unleash into a severe economic downturn as it happened in 2008-2009, yet it will be strong enough to choke the long term growth prospects of advanced economies. It may lead onto deflation (freezing of prices) in the short run; similar to situation confronted by Japan for over two decades. And in the long run, it may morph onto a period of hyperinflation, in particular if the prices of oil ramp up. This phenomenon of over-indebtedness also increases the probability of a long secular bear market in stocks and bonds; with savvy investors gravitating towards gold and precious metals. This is logical realignment of investment direction given the fact that gold and precious metals provide reasonable hedge against inflation.<strong>The Principles Of Austrian Economics, </strong>The objective of this article is to summarize the principles of economics related to the Austrian school of economics. The Austrian school originated at the University of Vienna by Carl Menger. Today, the Austrian school represents a different perspective from the mainstream economics. The key principles of Austrian school are summarized below:1. Menger was of view that Economics and physical sciences were quite different in so far that the former involved human emotions, which are quite difficult to measure; whereas the latter involved dimensions which can be readily measured.2. The Austrian and Mainstream economics have common views on Margin Utility. People tend to acquire first what gives them the maximum satisfaction; and give up first what gives them the least satisfaction. The measurement of Margin Utility is highly subjective and cannot be quantified easily. It varies from one individual to another.3. Friedrich Hyek and Ludwig Von Mises argued that the booms and busts originate due to injection of money by the policy makers. Driven by greed, the investors make investment decisions. When money is withdrawn and investors realize about wrong investment decisions, consumers pull back and the artificial boom collapses. The state and society may not be right in making decisions. It is the individual who would make choices and decisions. Therefore it is absolutely essential to understand how individuals make their choices (decisions). Economics is highly subjective and is different from other sciences in so far we cannot make direct measurements in economics. All economic decisions are intrinsically subjective and depend on the perception and values of individuals.4. Markets are in a continuous state of flux. The market actors strive for competition to identify gaps, fill these needs and make profits. Competition is a continuous process of discovery.5. Production cannot be re-used in most cases and changes in demand can affect the production process substantially. Production is inherently quite risky.6. Inflation is dangerous for economic stability. Money is like a commodity. If the government circulates more money in the economy, its value dips with the net result of overall increase in the price level. The government and Central Banks by pumping too much money would bring temporary booms only. When things get settled down, the economy recoils back to the real equilibrium but with greater level of inflation.7. Government intervention is not justified, even if it is well-intentioned. Government cannot ascertain precise information at certain point of time. First because individuals keep changing their plans and second it becomes quite different to read the mind and behavior of individuals. The government often makes wrong judgments and distorts equilibrium, which cannot be visible to the policy makers due to complexity of ever changing human perception of values.8. Society as a whole does not have its own collective mind or purpose. It is the individuals who have their own independent minds and not society per se. Economic events emanate from these individual decisions. It is because of the emphasis of the Austrian economics on individual decisions that they do not give much importance to macroeconomics.9. Low interest rates, unfortunately, fuel credit-booms that would motivate investors to invest in wrong places. When the bubble bursts, the waste in the investment process becomes obvious. Moreover with lower interest rates people tend to borrow more from banks, sometimes beyond their capacity. The fractional reserve banking system reinforces this phenomenon. When the artificial trends are reversed, the economy contracts and moves into recession.10. According to Austrian economists, inflation is not defined in terms of rising price level but in terms of increasing money supply. They use the term of “inflationary expansion” generally triggered by the government policies. Most important, the Austrian economists believe that the rise of price index is not accurate barometer of inflation in the economy. Price index is determined by the choice of underlying basket of goods. This choice is arbitrary and will produce different results. One solution could be to peg dollar to a commodity like gold. Unfortunately this is not a practical solution because of “limited amount” of gold in the world. Hayek had suggested the idea of competition among currencies. It is easier said than done. Governments and central banks by the end of day will exercise tight controls to defeat the ideas of competing currencies.To conclude, the Austrian school is more focused on individual behavior and choices. It does not support macroeconomic interventions by the governments, at least in the Keynesian sense of monetary policy management, to keep interest rates low for a long period of time (as happened in the US since 2006). This artificial dampening of rates would eventually fuel temporary credit booms likely to be busted at some stage. The end result is nothing but downturn in the economy, this time perhaps accompanied with soaring prices.<strong>The Virtue Of Staying Invested, </strong>The objective of this article is to make readers realize that long term investors will benefit from the volatile markets of today.In an era of rapid information movement, markets have developed significant “mood swings”. These swings are not driven by “market fundamentals” alone; “news hype” would significantly impact market movements and valuations as well. In other words, there are three key players which affect the modern capital markets: first speculators who attempt to ride the wave of markets in the hope of making short term gains; second conventional financial media which 1es hyped news to attract masses; and third burgeoning social media channels generating democratization of ideas. These three forces in combination with advanced emerging technologies have generated ubiquitous information causing improved efficiency in the global capital markets. This means market fundamentals lag behind these information waves; thereby producing volatility in the global capital markets.The positive news is that regardless of the market environment, investors always find some opportunities for growth. More important, investors profit from this volatility by exercising patience and staying invested in the long term.Investors can weather volatility by adopting following key smoothing strategies:1. Focus on long term strategies while ignoring short term volatility.2. Perform dollar-cost averaging which means buying stocks at different points of time regularly. You buy cheap stocks when markets are down. This is obviously an efficient strategy to average out the cost of purchasing stocks.3. Re-align your portfolio to your specific risk profile. Invest in stocks if you have a higher risk profile, and invest in the fixed income securities if you have lower tolerance for risk.4. Rebalance your portfolio: you need to keep your portfolio (combination of equities and fixed income) balanced; aligning to changing market conditions.5. When everybody is buying stocks and the economy has reached its peak, perhaps it is time to switch to more conservative investing. When market has declined substantially, it might be a good idea to purchase equities and offload bonds and fixed income securities.Following are some examples of outstanding investment opportunities emerging during financial-economic crisis:1. In the period 1929-1932, about 11,000 banks collapsed while the value of stocks declined by over 70%. In the post depression era, some giants like Toyota and Walt Disney emerged.2. The 1970s was a period of high inflation in North America and Europe. This situation was exacerbated by hike in oil prices-both by the 1973 oil embargo crisis as well as the geopolitical turmoil wrought by the Iranian revolution of 1979. During this period, some of the opportunities which emerged were software giant Microsoft and the cell-phones. These technologies have revolutionized the world.3. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a series of economic recessions which led to failure of more than 1600 banking institutions in the US. Notwithstanding this mass-scale failure of Banks, the financial stability was maintained due to promise of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits. Consequently there was no panic or bank run as was witnessed during the Great Depression. The invention of Internet in the 1990s and the compact discs in the 1980s were some outstanding developments of the period.4. The economic crisis of 2007-2008 has shifted the focus of investment opportunities toward the emerging economies. The potential high growth of big five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) as well as Frontier economies will continue to attract investors for investment in these economies. The rapid flow of information, growth of mobile internet and 3G technologies and emergence of social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) will go a long way in the globalization of investment portfolios.To conclude, global capital markets have become quite efficient due to growth of fast information underpinned by the emerging technologies. This has produced greater volatility though. Successful investors will pick the right investments and stay invested steadfast for reasonable length of time (for example five to seven years). The principle of modern day efficient markets is: rolling stone gathers no moss.<strong>How Macroeconomic Theories Explain Differences In Currency Values, </strong>Economists have generally put forth following key economic theories which elucidate fluctuations in the relative valuations of currencies. These major theories are briefly explained below:1-The international Fisher effect: According to this theory, the value of currencies between two countries A and B would be driven by the difference between the nominal interest rates. For example, the currency of the lower nominal rate currency should appreciate against the higher nominal rate currency by the same amount.2-The Asset Market Model: This model focuses on how much money is flowing into any country to purchase stocks, bonds and other securities. The greater the flow of capital, the more will be the appreciation of the recipient currency.3-The Monetary Model: The Central Bank and the Treasury play an important role in controlling inflation; and concomitantly triggering expectations about future inflationary trends. Lower rates and easy monetary policy (operating typically at full employment level) would raise inflationary expectations about future. If credit is available easily, it will automatically lead to credit boom and consequently increase in the price level.4-The real rate difference between two countries: when real rates are higher, currencies in those countries will appreciate. Conversely, countries with lower rates will decline in value. This is because foreign and domestic investors will invest in countries with higher real interest rates.5-The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is another interesting theory which states that the cost (price) of all commodities should be equalized across all countries. Currency of country with lower inflation should appreciate against the higher inflation country.6-The balance of payments theory postulates that a country running larger current account balance will face a downward pressure on its currency. During the Asian flu of 1997, the currencies of Asian economies underwent massive depreciation after the number of non-performing loans of local banks (denominated in the US dollar) escalated. Remember Current Account is only one factor in the stability of currency. Other factors also count towards the strength of the local currency. For example, the US has been running deficits for a long period of time, yet the US dollar gains “periodic strength” during economic crisis. This is because US dollar is considered as a safe haven currency.To conclude, these economic theories work only under specific assumptions (conditions) in a perfect world with little or no transaction costs and perfect mobility of capital. In the real world, there are uncountable factors which determine the exchange rate at certain point of time. These theories might work; assuming low transaction costs and other hiccups in the long run. In the short run, macroeconomic indicators are a better barometer for currency valuation.<strong>The Holy Grail of Investing </strong>In the book, “The Management of Investment Decisions”, “the authors write that: successful and sophisticated investors have learned over the last 20 years to concentrate their energy on managing their investment decisions, rather than trying to choose winning stocks or top performing money managers. They have earned superior investment returns as a result of developing a prudent investment process and strategy and then sticking to it.”Securities picked on the basis of hot companies or tips often end in a fiasco. Remember that returns on a Portfolio are driven by the overall strategic interaction and performance (asset allocation) of the underlying constituent elements. Individual securities standalone do not matter much. It is all about asset allocation that drives the Portfolio returns.Following factors are important to consider when designing Strategic Portfolio:1. What is the length of time that funds can be put onto the plan?2. What is the end goal or objective of the investor?3. What is the risk tolerance? This leads to the key question of which asset classes will form the Portfolio.4. Design of the Portfolio is based on the asset allocation strategy. How much needs to be invested in each class? Further, what strategies need to be deployed to optimize asset allocation?5. What are the macroeconomic and industry factors? What is the current point in the business cycle? Is the stock market volatile?6. What level of diversification is required to minimize volatility of stocks and help the investors meet their long term goals?7. Other questions to include: liquidity, accessibility, drawing income from funds etc.The Strategic Portfolio Management process entails the following steps:1. Analyze the needs, requirements, time horizon and risk tolerance of the investor. This is typically embodied in a document called as “Investment Policy Statement.”2. Design the Portfolio driven by the needs (and analysis) of the investor. The core strategy of design of Portfolio is based on “Asset Allocation” (which securities and in what proportion are selected?). Again the key drivers of this allocation strategy will be the objective, time-horizon and risk tolerance of the investor.3. After completion of the analysis and design of the Portfolio, the next key steps involve appropriate documentation and implementation of the Portfolio Management process. Documentation is done using the Investment Policy Statement; which includes the risk profile of the investor, her age, needs, liquidity requirements, objectives and related goals. The document also spells out investment policy, asset allocation strategy and specific guidelines toward implementation and monitoring of the Portfolio.4. Perhaps the most important step of Portfolio Management is its effective monitoring. One key step entails rebalancing of the Portfolio, which needs to be done consistently. Rebalancing, if not done in a timely manner, can have serious hidden costs. For example, if your Portfolio is designed at 60% equities and 40% fixed investments; and as the stock market goes up, your allocation of equities increases to 70%. This new allocation exposes you to greater risks of stock market swings. Any decline in the stock market will lead to greater damage to unbalanced Portfolio. The logical inference is that the Portfolio needs to be rebalanced to 60% equities and 40% fixed investments again. This rebalancing to align risk tolerance of the investors to the expected returns is at the very heart of the Portfolio Management process.', 1, '2013-01-19 21:00:12', '2013-01-19 21:00:12', 0),

There was a wave of political brinkmanship over Sovereign debt problems in Europe as well as the fiscal cliff in the US. Ironically, the macroeconomic instability could not deter the rebound of global equity markets, which have generated positive returns in 2012. The S&P 500 index recorded a stellar performance of 16%; primarily driven by strong fundamentals taking position in the US economy. It is noteworthy to state that the US housing and job markets have shown significant improvements, thereby improving the consumer confidence. On a similar note in Europe, the German, French and even Greek Markets had shown amazing performance in 2012. It looks like that positive expectations about future outcomes in Europe and the US have weighed heavily on the directions of their respective stock markets.In comparison to the US and European Stock Markets, the Canadian Stock Market has under-performed in 2012. The S&P/TSX composite index registered a mediocre return of 4% mainly because of slumping energy and materials sectors, which had -3.6% and -6.9% YTD returns in Dec 2012. Paradoxically, gold and commodities stocks have performed worst than their underlying commodities. Further there are signs of softening of the Canadian housing market, amidst risks of rising debt to income ratio of Canadian consumers. The 2013 outlook points to some degree of volatility due to fiscal cliff and European Sovereign debt issues. The Chinese manufacturing is in the positive domain and the US fundamentals will trigger further surge of the S&P 500 index. The key question is: what will be the threshold point of Volatility which will not deter the investors from taking positions in the Capital Markets? In either case, the prices of commodities and yields of blue chip stocks and corporate bonds are expected to remain robust through 2013. The key driver of commodities will be the Chinese growth; while the yield on blue chip stocks and high quality corporate bonds will be driven by increasing premium over highly depressed interest rates.', 1, '2013-01-22 03:16:23', '2013-01-22 03:16:23', 0),

(285, 'Three Ways To Measure GDP', 'Gross Domestic Product GDP is the aggregate of goods and services produced in a country. There are three ways to compute GDP:1-The Output Approach: This is calculated by summing up Value Added activities across the production economy, while eliminating instances of double counting. The challenge with this approach is to get right accounting data, which would focus on Value Added activities.2-The Expenditure Approach: The expenditure approach is measured by adding consumption, investment, exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services. Consumption is both private and government sponsored. In the developed economies, consumption constitutes 50-70% component of GDP. Investment is undertaken by private investors. The "total final expenditure" equals the sum of Consumption expenditure, investments and exports of goods and services.3-The Income Approach: The income approach of GDP measurement is based on premise that we total the income of all factors of production. Specifically, these incomes include wages or salaries of employees, self-employment income, profits of companies, rental income and profit of government corporations.These three approaches never reach the same number. The key reasons for their discrepancy are attributable to black economy, limitations of data, voluntary services and some transactions which cannot be translated in monetary terms. Notwithstanding these discrepancies, another noise that accentuates the GDP variations in different countries is the difference in price levels or inflation rates existing at different places. Purchasing Power Parity method could be one way to smooth out these fluctuations albeit some caveats about how data is obtained. In addition, most economists predict degree of convergence of GDP growth rates between the developing and the developed countries in the next decade. The emerging economies of the world, in particular BRIC nations are catching up fast to reach GDP levels of OECD countries in near future. However, what economists do not take into account is the fact that it is not GDP growth rate per se what matters most, but the quality and per capita trends of GDP growth as well.More important, GDP might not explain some key intangibles like technological advancement, rule of law and quality of living and education existing in some developed countries. For example, the US Economy has huge intangibles in terms of Technological advancement which would make it a global leader for a long time to come. To conclude, GDP growth standalone is not a strong measure of economic prosperity and has to be analyzed in tandem with other qualitative measures of economic affluence.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7481657', 1, '2013-03-31 18:37:34', '2014-03-24 23:53:10', 1),
(286, 'Investing As a Discipline', 'There is no free lunch in the world of investments. Learn from the history of Stocks and Bonds because: "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it-George Santayana". High investment returns cannot be earned without taking substantial risk. Safe investments produce lower returns. As markets are becoming more volatile and unpredictable, the quest for higher returns is coming at the cost of higher risks only.Good companies are generally bad stocks and bad companies are generally good stocks. On a similar note, when the political and economic outlook is positive, returns are relatively lower. Intuitively, when things look gloomy, the returns could potentially be at the highest level. This is because in a period of uncertainty, investors discount future stock income at a higher rate. This would results into lower stock prices with higher expected future returns. Counter-intuitively, when economic environment is optimistic, it is not feasible to invest; because future income is discounted at lower rates or lower perceived risks. This results into higher stock prices and lower expected returns.Recall that according to Gordon equation: Market Return=Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth. The drivers of dividend yield and dividend growth is corporate earnings. Over the long term, if the annualized earnings growth rate is about 7%, then the stock price, on annualized basis, should trail this number as well.For bonds, the expected return in the long run is simply its coupon or interest payments. Typically the coupon rate will not change. There is an additional caveat though. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds decline; but the rate at which the interest is reinvested will rise partially offsetting the decline in the value of bonds. In nutshell, the long term bond returns will dovetail the coupon rate.The fundamental return of the Stock Market - the sum of long term dividend growth and dividend yield - are somewhat predictable in the long run. However the short term movement driven by volatility and speculation cannot be predicted. There are three "time-bound" drivers of stock prices: dividends in the short term and P/E multiples for short term speculation. For the long term stock value and growth, it is all about dividend growth, indirectly driven by the corporate earnings, using the Gordon equation. In other words, it is possible to predict long term trend of stock market based on Gordon equation to quite an extent; but not possible to make short term predictions due to high degree of volatility and speculations or noise.When the discount rate goes up, the stock prices go down. Higher discount rate implies higher anticipated risk and returns and therefore lower price. In fact, some bad companies can show excellent temporary performance. Tom Peters in his book "In Search of Excellence" demonstrated that the un-excellent companies excelled the excellent companies by a stunning 11% margin per year.Past superior performance has no guarantees for future performance. The capital markets are ruthlessly efficient. Stock picking and timing markets are very costly mistakes. Because there are so many money managers analyzing stocks, their collective wisdom is reflected instantaneously in the stock prices. Thus stock prices behave random and unpredictable. This concept is known as EMH-Efficient Market Hypothesis. Fama was one of its proponents. One example of existence of EMH is that Value Line has not been able to beat the Market Index.Professional Asset Management is a very tough business. Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch are the only two managers who have shown solid evidence of skill. Other managers excelled for a short while and then went into oblivion.Mutual Funds costs are bad news for the investors. There are four key costs of Mutual Funds:(A)-The funds Expense ratio or MER which is listed in the Prospectus and Annual Statements.(B)-The fund''s Advisory Fees, administrative expenses and commissions paid on transactions. These costs are imbued in such a way that it becomes very difficult to identify how these costs would eat into the returns on these funds.(C)-Bid-Ask Spread: This is the difference between the higher purchase price and lower sale price. The Bid-Ask spread increases with decreasing size of Company.(D)-Finally the impact and rebalancing costs; accrued from external Macroeconomic environment which imbalance the asset allocation strategy and misaligns the composition of Portfolio and its risk matrix.The key driver of a perfect Portfolio is Asset Allocation - built around diversification. The asset allocation is also a function of your risk tolerance and tracking error. Investing in one stock can be quite risky. Your overall asset allocation is determined by your objective, risk tolerance, time horizon and tax situation.Finance is purely behavioral as pointed out by many economists. Greed and Fear will rule investor behavior for all times to come. Most important of all, when investors are pessimist, there is greater expected return in future and vice versa.The major behavior mistakes do not let us achieve our investment goals: limiting beliefs, myopic vision, biases, reliance on patterns, irrational exuberance, herd mentality, the great company illusion, inconsistency and timing the market.It is difficult and counter-productive to clone smart money managers for two reasons: Past good performers sometimes tank; while laggards could potentially perform quite well in future. Second, stellar performance trails funds accumulation from all sources; which ultimately increases exposure to impact costs and misalignment of Portfolio to risk profile. For example, Peter Lynch, the greatest Mutual Funds Manager of all times witnessed diminishing returns of his funds as he scaled up the size of funds and volume of transactions.Start your retirement planning today. Divide your savings into two categories: the long term retirement account invested in a well diversified Portfolio; and a taxable account to meet any financial emergency. This taxable account should normally contain six months of your income to weather any unforeseen liquidity risks. In addition, to this you must also have adequate life and disability insurance."Survivorship Bias" is a major cause of overstated Performance of Funds. Simply put it is about focusing on short term period when the funds have performed quite well. Some Fund Managers perform well in the short run but if you factor in the long run performance, these funds record below average returns. It is absolutely important to take into account long term performance of the fund and not rely on short term victories, which generally reverse over the long haul.To conclude, using the above principles you can design your own KISS or "Keep it simple and sensible" Portfolio with better performance and less costs than most funds. Remember the real value add will come from disciplining your emotions, rebalancing the Portfolio and staying the course.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7473901', 1, '2013-03-31 18:38:28', '2014-03-24 23:43:00', 1),

(288, 'The Resilience of Canadian Economy', 'The Canadian economy emerged unscathed from the global downturn in 2008-2009; mainly on account of its vibrant financial system, resilient corporate sector, stable housing market and prudent Fiscal-Monetary policies. This article analyzes key risks and opportunities to the Canadian economy in 2013 and beyond.1-The Canadian economy is cyclical insofar one-third of its size is based on exports, and that too is weighted heavily in commodities and metals. Foreign trade also shapes the relative strength or weakness of the Canadian dollar (CAD). When the global economy is undergoing uncertainty, the CAD slips more than its counterpart the US dollar (USD). Historically, the USD and Yen, reckoned as safe haven currencies, have enjoyed massive capital inflows in an era of uncertainty. Conversely, when the global economy shows signs of recovery, the CAD inches up against the USD - primarily on account of viable banking system in Canada as well as commodities boom triggered by the emerging economies, notably China. Note Canada is a key exporter of commodities sector and the TSX Exchange is a leader in the Mining industry.2-Currently there is a huge global shift going on in the composition of the Global GDP; which was weighed heavily in favor of developed economies two decades back and is now poised to be tilted in favor of emerging economies in the next decade. The key implication of this radical global transition is emergence of the powerful emerging Asian economies, China and India in particular. These emerging economies will execute huge appetite for commodities and metals; and therefore galvanize the Canadian and Australian economies. This outlook underpins the strength of the CAD in comparison to the USD in the next 4-5 years.3-The two key challenges to the Canadian economy, from the perspective of current global economic risks, are the negative impact of the European debt crisis and the fragility of the US economy. Any serious fallout in Europe can send economic seismic waves to the Global banking system, and Canada will not be insulated from this shock either. This could result into weakening of growth and productivity and exacerbate the already pronounced unemployment level in Canada. The key reason behind this scenario will be serious financial constraints existing in the World''s biggest economy in the neighborhood of Canada. These constraints are attributable to an unsustainable National debt and its flawed fiscal management policies. Unfortunately, this bottleneck did not exist in 2008 when Lehman brothers collapsed under the weight of prime debt crisis.4-The above analysis candidly indicates that the interest rate environment will stay depressed in 2012 and some part of 2013. Conditional on economic stabilization in the US in 2012 and some kind of European debt solution, the global economy led by the BRIC nations might pick up pace towards the end of 2012 (start of 2013). This trend, in tandem with already rising asset prices in China and India, will trigger hike in interest rates in Canada.5-The key impact of interest rate hike, conditional on Global economic recovery, would be on the already over-valued real estate in Canada. Real estate prices, in particular related to the Condominium market of Toronto, are over-valued by 10-15% and any interest hike will lead to spontaneous correction of the real estate market. This would not come any time soon, but once rates begin to spike up somewhere in 2013, the housing market may get pushed into a longer cycle of stagnation spread over few years. This alludes to the fact that Alternative Investments, in particular commodities and metals, will be leading vehicles for Wealth creation in Canada in the next decade.Article Source: <a href="http://EzineArticles.com/7297679">http://EzineArticles.com/7297679</a>', 1, '2013-03-31 18:41:34', '2014-03-24 22:14:05', 1),
(289, 'European Debt Crisis ', 'In this article, I plan to highlight seven key issues faced by Europe currently, which could have a formidable impact on the European and Global Financial Systems in future. The key repercussion of this escalating European and the US debt will be: 1-Weaker capacity of governments to deal with future crisis; 2-Deteriorating impact on currencies and paper money; 3-High Inflation expectations which will drive demand of gold; 4-Pressure on governments of developed countries to attend to the needs of a growing population of the baby boomers; and 5-Incapacity of Central Banks to keep the interest rates lower.Issue One: The documentation of Current Accounts (and the Economy) and its effective auditing never prevailed in some of the European countries, notably in Greece. The clear manifestation of this loophole can be found in the ongoing Greek crisis. Nobody could predict that the problem could assume such horrendous dimensions. Who has the right accounting record to fathom the magnitude of problem even today?Issue Two: The European Central Bank (ECB) did not design a robust fire-fighting mechanism to cope with the highly indebted European countries. The member states built massive debts on their balance sheets. This is also part of the Moral Hazard issue which means not to act so responsibly in the hope of getting bailed out ultimately.Issue Three: Mass Psychology and Program Trading can exacerbate the situation in an uncertain environment. The Greek debt crisis had a snowball effect on debt securities of Spain and Italy. The credit spread for their bonds has increased in the past six months. As a result, these heavily indebted countries have fallen into a vicious trap on account of increased debt and ensuing risks to the economy. Logically, increased riskiness leads to hike in interest rates, which dampens the economy and stock markets. For ECB, this implies worsening of already deteriorated balance sheet.Issue Four: Politics cannot be divorced from Economic Policy. The current austerity measures tailored by the Greek government would always face resistance from its people. Social and political divergence in Europe, rooted in rich historical traditions, would always lead to weaker implementation of the Structural Adjustment Plans - a recipe practiced by the IMF in emerging economies for many decades.Issue Five: Germany, with a stable and a strong economy, remains as a leader and role model in Europe. Yet it does not have a well-designed mechanism or political influence to facilitate reforms in other members of the ECB - of course using ECB as a bastion of reforms. Divergent European economies are more sensitive to imposition of external solutions, let alone emulating the economic accomplishments of Germany in the post-unification era.Issue Six: Economists never analyze Debt in isolation, neither for companies nor for countries. For economies, it is benchmarked to real GDP growth. Stringent fiscal measures can muster some discipline in the short run; yet in the long run this would dampen the recession further. Using the analogy of a household it might be a good idea to curtail expenditure; better still would be to generate greater income and budget it for rainy days!Issue Seven: Most important of all, the European debt solution is a long term struggle given both the complexity of issues; and typical fiscal policy time-lags. Imposition of austerity measures unilaterally can sink Europe (already in recession) into deflation, witnessed by Japan in the 1990s. Deflation, defined as persistent decrease in price level, is detrimental to the growth of economy and the stock markets. The solution to avoid Deflation rests on a three pronged strategy: 1-Building fiscal discipline in highly indebted European countries; 2-Designing a painless exit strategy of defaulting economies in order to avoid complete crumbling of the European Monetary Union; and 3-Creating a powerful external mechanism that would stimulate the moribund European economies.', 1, '2013-03-31 18:42:30', '2014-03-24 23:44:56', 1),
(290, 'European and US Debt Crisis ', 'Ironically the US Treasuries always gain strength in an uncertain economic environment, despite Credit downgrading of the US Treasury bonds. Why? The US Treasuries, despite some serious Debt implications, are still viewed by the Markets as much safer and risk free instruments. In my opinion, the European debt issue is far from over - there are some countries which have over-leveraged Debt to GDP ratios; Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Italy to name few.What we need to discern is a subtle difference between the US and the European debt issues. These issues may sound similar, but they are quite different both in terms of economic scope and political underpinnings. The US debt, undoubtedly, is a long term challenge as demonstrated by a marked increase in the spread between the yields of Ten year Notes and the corresponding Inflation Protected Treasury securities. The economics is quite simple: more deficit means greater debt; more debt implies higher rates and inflationary pressures; and if they are out of balance this would result in currency crisis, massive devaluations and disturbance of global financial balance.The European debt is a more complicated issue, at least from the standpoint of the geo-economic structure. The US debt issue, notwithstanding the massive size of debt touching $13 trillion plus, is manageable in so far the government apparatus and the Fed are well positioned to attend to any unexpected movement of debt limits. This may not be the case for the European Union - which is facing a dilemma of aligning political and economic interests. For instance, if Greece were to default and its debt restructured, it would relinquish membership of the European Union. Why? Because its currency will have to undergo massive devaluations to re-align the backlog of its horrendous debt and put the house in order again. This is not possible while its strings are attached to the European Central Bank. Ironically this guaranteed cushion by the European Central Bank might promote moral hazard for countries to take on debt and buy time. Such an eventuality might trigger a more serious crisis at a later stage; the solution lies in both short term injection of capital and long term scrutiny to ward-off risks to overleveraged economies.The Fed has deployed unprecedented quantitative easing in history, by utilizing $2.86 trillion Balance Sheet, in order to keep the short term interest rates to near zero level. Remember the Fed has already injected a mammoth dose of $2.3 trillion into the Financial System since the collapse of Lehman Holdings in September 2008. The probability of the Fed continuing this stance of keeping rates on lower end would most likely continue; the key drivers are the slumping Mortgage Insurance and ailing housing markets. Any increase in rates would put unbearable pressure on $914.4 billion of Mortgage-backed debt of the Fed. Concomitantly, the Obama administration is struggling to close massive federal budget deficit of $2 to $4 trillion.In this environment, Treasuries are most likely to rebound in the short term; while yields on Treasury Inflation Protected (TIPS) would escalate in the long term. In my viewpoint, an unstoppable escalation of this "spread" between the two (which would run somewhat parallel to an inverted yield curve) would signal potential threat to the Global economy. Here is the "economics story" behind this key trend witnessed recently:1. Burgeoning Fiscal deficit would prop up the National debt of the US, unless domestic Savings are capable enough to fill the gap - which is not the case.2. Deficits and National debts cannot go beyond certain threshold, without inflicting damage to the economic balance. This is true in case of the US as well although the Fed can print dollars literally from the "thin air" as long as it wants to do so.3. If debt exceeds permissible limits, the first thing to be hit will be the interest rates. Higher rates will cause insurmountable burden on debt servicing as well as dampen consumer demand. Note Consumer spending, impacted directly by the strength of the housing market, is the main driver of GDP growth in the US.4. Higher rates will prove detrimental to a very fragile housing market, which is already facing pressures from an ailing Mortgage Insurance market (a new emerging trend).5. Remember that any quantitative easing by the Fed will keep rates low in the short run; but will come at a cost of burgeoning National debt and consequent expectations about inflations in the future.6. Bonds (Treasuries as well as Debentures) move in an opposite direction to interest rates. Future expectations of lower yields would mean higher price (compensation) for Bonds.7. Finally, interest rates and inflation would move hand in gloves. In this game, expectations are the key determinant of any future play out. Markets are driven by psychological factors - greed and fear - as much as by fundamental factors. In my viewpoint, presently the psychological factors, fear in particular, have masked the "fundamentals" to a great extent. The solution lies in a firm commitment of the Fed and the Government to keep the Fiscal deficits and the National Debts within a plausible limit of the GDP.Last but not least, China is playing a very critical role in maintaining "global financial balance" - it is holding trillions of dollars and Euros of debt; and pumping its exports onto the US and the European Markets. Hefty "consumerism" of Chinese products in the US and Europe is extremely important to keep China churning its exports - any reversal can strain this delicate "financial balance" immensely.', 1, '2013-03-31 18:43:58', '2014-03-24 23:44:39', 1),
(291, 'A Primer on Stock Investing (Part 1) ', 'The objective of this article is to summarize some key metrics of stock investments and valuation; and help investors make informed decisions using a relatively simple framework.There has been a plethora of information on stock investing, regularly bombarded on investors by financial media. This flood of information is disseminated by multiple media channels. Some of these industry resources provide valuable information, yet these reports may not help in making informed decisions. Studies have shown that Value line, with its highly sophisticated analysis, can hardly compete with the Market index. Research has demonstrated that beating the Market index needs "superior" analysis and right timed execution. The term used for this unique skill is Alpha; and some examples of Alpha seeking Gurus are Warren Buffet, George Soros, Peter Lynch and others.Before delving into a more pragmatic framework of stocks, it is important to define different categories of stock investing. Stocks are broadly categorized as either common stocks or preferred stocks. The key difference between the two is characterized by the following. First, preferred stocks are preferred, as the name implies, over common stocks in terms of claim by the shareholders in case of default by the company. Second, preferred stocks are purchased to get dividends (income) with less potential for appreciation; while common stocks may be used for both dividends as well as capital appreciation, with focus on the latter. Third, preferred stocks behave like bonds in some cases, as interest rates go up the price of preferred would typically go down. Interest rate variation has some degree of correlation with stock market as a whole because as interest rates go up the stock market gets hit. For individual common stocks, interest rate variation effects will depend on a number of factors, in particular the capital (or debt) structure of the firm.Other categories of common stocks include: First blue chip stocks of well reputed Dow Jones companies with established history of dividends payments to investors. Second, value stocks are under-valued gems, likely to grow in the long run. Third, growth stocks as the name implies are growth oriented stocks which are priced higher because of their perception of appreciation in future. Fourth, cyclical stocks which are sensitive to swings in the business cycles. And fifth, stocks which stay calm during market swings such as Utilities.The key metrics of stock investing are summarized below:1-52 Weeks High-Low: Find out the price of the stocks prevailing in the stock market and compare the current price to past 52 weeks of high and low prices of the same stock. The idea is simple: stocks having lower price range in the rising markets have greater upward potential than stocks which have already reached high 52 week mark.2-Market Capitalization: This metric reflects how big the company is. Market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding of the company by the prevailing market price. Typically stocks are classified as large cap, mid-cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks, like Exxon, generally do not have a great upward potential of price increase as compared to some gems in the category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The latter category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks has the highest probability of representing emerging star investments, which typically multiply and grow ten-fold in a certain time period.3-Volume: This metric tells us how much dollars are being traded on a single day. Volume is computed by multiplying number of stocks in trading on a particular day by the average price. Blue chip stocks like Exxon, Microsoft and Apple have larger volume. In contrast, small and mid-cap stocks have smaller volume, thereby creating some liquidity risk.4-Earnings growth (past and future): This is a key metric which determines the price of stocks. Earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the earnings of the company by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings growth (year over year YOY) is important from two angles: whether earnings have grown in the past five years; and whether actual earnings have exceeded the predicted earnings in the current year. The performance of growth companies particularly is judged by the corresponding growth of earnings. Interestingly earnings per share is diluted by the issuance of more shares; or conversion of fixed income securities onto common stocks. This action would decrease the value of EPS. In contrast, if a company buys back its shares, the earnings per share would increase proportionately. For example, if a company, abundant in cash reserves, buys back half of its shares, the EPS would arithmetically double, making it more attractive to the stock investors. Remember EPS is strongly correlated to the price of stock. Consequently, buying back stocks and assuming that the external factors do not change can eventually lead to increase in the price of stocks.5-Price to earnings (P/E) ratio: Despite the fact that this ratio has some caveats, P/E is the most popular ratio in the world of stock investing. P/E ratio is simply the current price of stock divided by the 12 months trailing earnings (although analysts sometimes use 12 months of forecasted earnings as well). Growth investors would like growth in earnings regardless of the direction of the price of stock. Conversely, the value investors want to see declining P/E ratio in order to hunt for the undervalued gems. Value investors typically go after companies whose earnings growth rate is higher than the P/E ratio. The second metric admired by the value investors is the existence of the current P/E ratio falling below the past five year average.6-Price to Sales (P/S): There is general perception that sometimes companies would twist accounting methods in order to manipulate earnings. It is rather difficult to apply such manipulation to the sales numbers. This metric throws light on how much money you are willing to pay for the sales generated by the company. For growth companies, this number should continue to be smaller. However growth investors will not care much about this ratio as compared to value investors. The value investors would like to see this ratio lower.7-Price to Book ratio (P/B): The book value means how much a company is worth if it was liquidated today. The price to book ratio is a simple comparison of stock''s price to net asset value of the company. The main caveat is that this metric focuses on tangible assets of the company. Investment research has revealed that intangibles also play a very significant role in the value creation for the shareholders. It is for this reason that P/B ratio is not a comprehensive metric.8-Value creation and growth metrics: Most stock analysts typically focus on EPS (Earnings per share) metric for the past five years. Although earnings and sales are like life bloodline of a company, yet basing stock investing decisions on earnings (and sales) standalone can be misleading. More specifically, the analyst should undertake more detailed analysis of the following three key areas that determine the earnings (sales) of the company eventually:a-The quality of revenue earned by the company and transparency (compliance standards) of revenue recognition. What are the growth prospects of the company?b-The net profit margin or quality of earnings: what is the strategy of a company to optimize costs and increase return on investments? Of course, management plays a critical to enhance the size and quality of earnings.c-What is the position of cash flows? It is important to purchase stocks of companies with positive cash flows.9-Dividend Yield: This metric is generally relevant for large blue chip companies, such as those constituting the Dow Jones Industrial average. It is less relevant for small and high growth companies, because these companies hardly declare any dividends. Some investors, depending on their risk profile and investment goals will prefer large companies churning dividends consistently.10-Relative Price Strength: This metric compares last year price performance of stocks within a congruent group. Similar comparison between stock siblings is made for Earnings per share. This type of analysis is typically done by Investor''s Business Daily.11-Return on Equity (ROE): is an important metric, which explains how much money the company is making at the behest of the shareholders'' equity. In simple terms, it elucidates whether the company is efficiently utilizing resources at its disposal and is making profit. This metric is particularly relevant for growth investors. Growth companies should keep track of Return on Equity (ROE) to ensure that the growth projects are generating positive net present value (NPV). The ROE metric clearly speaks of the depth and competency of the management.12-Insider Ownership: It is generally argued that the larger size of the insider ownership is a better indicator of the success of a company. This proposition makes sense because when owners are stakeholders, they would work hard to push the company to success. However this metric standalone cannot indicate the strength of a company. There could be periods when stakeholders would sell stocks to generate money from their changing personal and business needs.13-Forecast on Company''s performance: Value of a company is not based on its past performance. This is because past performance is only relevant to the extent that it can help analysts make some predictions about future trends and growth. However, there is no guarantee that the external environment would stay the same and that the company would repeat its past performance. Equally difficult is the forecast (predictions) about future earnings and revenues of the company. Investors should complete their own due diligence to analyze the possibility of meeting actual earnings and revenue goals.14-Integrity and Depth of Management: This is perhaps the most important metric to make an assessment about the future performance and direction of any company. Performance is a relative term; and will vary depending on the nature of company. For example, from the viewpoint of growth companies, performance is defined by year over year (YOY) growth while maintaining positive return on equity (ROE). For technology companies, performance is underpinned by successful launch of innovation in the guise of new product introductions. The caveat is that innovation is difficult to measure because of its rolling into both tangible and intangible domains. How can you, for example, measure the success or long term value of Apple iphones? The ubiquitous existence of disruptive technologies makes this task even harder. Overall, the depth, maturity and commitment of management is the most important metric to judge the future performance of a company.15-Volatility of Stocks: This metric is absolutely critical in making decisions about the Risk-Return profile of the investor. Put simply, volatility is a measure of how much returns deviate from the average value in a given period of time. Greater volatility implies greater risk. Volatility tends to be higher in the short run and would smooth out to some extent in the long run. Of course, volatility depends on the correlation of stock price to market swings (called as Beta).To conclude, the above framework must be analyzed in a holistic manner. Again these metrics, when combined together, will be viewed differently by the value and growth investors. The value investor would be focused on long term competitive advantage, reputation of brand and relative current valuation of the company. On the other hand, the growth investor will care about past and future growth patterns regardless of 52 week price fluctuations and growth potential (revenue generation) of the company.', 1, '2013-03-31 18:45:10', '2014-03-24 23:39:00', 1);

(300, 'Sovereign Debt Crisis', 'This brief article examines the fundamental question: what are the causes of burgeoning Sovereign debt of advanced economies? And what are the implications of this development for the global economy?Causes of escalating debt of Advanced EconomiesThe G-7 public debt as a percentage of GDP has increased consistently since 1977. It is important to note that the gross public debt or net public debt is not meaningful without being analyzed in the context of the Gross domestic product (GDP). The logic behind this metric is simple: if a country could double its GDP, the net effect of doubling its debt will be zero. This concept works similar to that of leverage in the equities market, which is considered as a double-edged sword. If the value of equity increases, profits are magnified using leverage. Conversely, if the value of equity declines, losses are amplified too. On a similar note, if a country can produce GDP at a rate faster that the rate of its debt accumulation, the country can build substantial capacity to absorb additional debt without thwarting its growth prospects.The main causes of debt escalation in the advanced economies are as follows:(A)-Fiscal stimulus packages in the aftermath of economic crisis of 2008. In particular, the US stimulus packages have been of unprecedented magnitude, which have increased the US national debt manifold.(B)-Nationalization of private debts of giant private banks, from Merrill Lynch to Citigroup.(C)-Incapacity of government to levy taxes and raise revenues. Overall, the above three factors have led to increased debt burdens acquired by the advanced economies.(D)-Aging population will put additional strain on the fiscal health of the advanced economies.Comparative analysis of Debt sustainability: Advanced vs. Emerging EconomiesAnalyzing the data of the IMF World Economic Outlook (Sep 2011), gross general Government debt as percent of GDP increased from 72.7% in 2000 to 79.9% in 2008 (the forecasts for 2016 are 108.2%). For G-7 advanced economies, gross general government debt as percent of GDP increased from 77.5% in 2000 to 90.3% in 2009 (the forecasts are 127.4%). The same numbers for the emerging and developing economies are 48.5% in 2000 to 32.5% in 2008 (with forecast of decline to 29.2% in 2016). This shows clearly that the debt levels have declined consistently in the emerging and developing countries.The Economics of Sovereign Debt Accumulation and InflationInflation is generally considered good for debtors, who would find it convenient to pay loans with cheaper dollars in future. But the bad news is that as money is pumped into the economy, inflation does not rise immediately and uniformly. Prices spread gradually across different sectors. Worst of all, it looks that these sectors are booming. But the temporary booms are adjusted with output contraction and the final result is escalation of price level. The current strategy of money supply as practiced in the US and Euro-zone to an extent, aiming to keep the interest rates low, will inflate these economies in near future. Fractional reserve banking will simply magnify this impact. Rising prices lead to massive depreciation of currencies, thereby creating misallocation of resources and economic inefficiencies. Governments have a tendency to acquire high levels of debt, unlike the private sector due to the following key factors:(A)-Government can impose taxes on public to raise revenue and pay off interest on debts. The private sector does not generally have such capacity to raise revenue painlessly.(B)-In case of Public debt, there is no precise metric (For example, debt at 60% of GDP) which could signal precisely what is going to happen in future (or raise red flags). Public debt has many caveats attached to it. It is rather difficult to simplify "public debt as percent of GDP". In contrast, it is pretty simple to use "debt to income" ratio for private individuals and companies. The Public debt analysis is arbitrary to an extent as explained above; while the Private debt is built around tight accounting principles.(C)-There is no international bankruptcy court or adjudication body to enforce legal contracts of national debt. It is in the interest of the governments not to default, as it can have serious political backlash. Also potential default would lead to downgrading of bonds by credit rating agencies, which would imply more expensive debt in future.(D)-There is some degree of Moral Hazard issues attached to Public debt, both in the advanced as well as emerging economies. What is Moral Hazard? It is a tendency by a party to take risks because the costs of any failure will not be borne by that party. For advanced economies, as happened during the economic crisis of 2008, the private banks and organizations indulge in irresponsible financial practices in the hope that they will be bailed out by the Government and Central Banks in the US, China and Europe.For emerging economies, Moral Hazard problem assumes different dimension. It is the government per se which resorts to Moral Hazard along with the private sector institutions. They take on massive debts without efficient utilization of money thereby inflating the economy (commonly called as Dutch disease). They foster hopes that the International development institutions like Asian Development Bank, IMF and World Bank will come to the rescue in case of potential default using tools like "Structural Adjustment Programs."Implications of Over-indebtedness of Advanced economiesFor the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) countries, the current debt situation is not sustainable. The recipe of austerity measures, apart from creating political backlash; acts as a countervailing force to monetary policy stimulus. This is because "austerity" entails cutting down on development expenditure and possibly increasing taxes. Given below full employment level of economy, as is the case for the Euro-zone currently, the current austerity measures will lead to further contraction of the economy. The paradox of "Euro-zone Austerity" measures is that these will choke growth and push the economy on a long term recessionary spiral path.In contrast, the US economy is much more "resilient" than the Euro-zone because of the following three key reasons: (A)-the US dollar remains as the international reserve currency; which not only makes US dollar as safe haven currency but also gives ability to the US government to borrow at lower interest rate; (B)-the fundamentals of the US economy are stronger than the Euro-zone individual economies; (C)-the innovation and productivity of the US economy is a very strong intangible, which will continue to add strength to the US dollar in the foreseeable future. However, the US growth might slow down in the short run because of the falling external demand (Europe in particular) for exports.Finally, if we make an analytical comparison between advanced and emerging economies, the probability of growth (accompanied with less debt burden) is much higher in the emerging economies than the advanced ones. The logical implication is that the emerging economies will most probably finance the deficits and growth of the advanced economies in the next decade.To conclude, the next economic crisis of Sovereign debt has already started. Perhaps it will not unleash into a severe economic downturn as it happened in 2008-2009, yet it will be strong enough to choke the long term growth prospects of advanced economies. It may lead onto deflation (freezing of prices) in the short run; similar to situation confronted by Japan for over two decades. And in the long run, it may morph onto a period of hyperinflation, in particular if the prices of oil ramp up. This phenomenon of over-indebtedness also increases the probability of a long secular bear market in stocks and bonds; with savvy investors gravitating towards gold and precious metals. This is logical realignment of investment direction given the fact that gold and precious metals provide reasonable hedge against inflation.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269819', 1, '2013-03-31 18:51:11', '2014-03-24 23:48:31', 1),
(301, 'Macroeconomic Theories', 'Economists have generally put forth following key economic theories which elucidate fluctuations in the relative valuations of currencies. These major theories are briefly explained below:1-The international Fisher effect: According to this theory, the value of currencies between two countries A and B would be driven by the difference between the nominal interest rates. For example, the currency of the lower nominal rate currency should appreciate against the higher nominal rate currency by the same amount.2-The Asset Market Model: This model focuses on how much money is flowing into any country to purchase stocks, bonds and other securities. The greater the flow of capital, the more will be the appreciation of the recipient currency.3-The Monetary Model: The Central Bank and the Treasury play an important role in controlling inflation; and concomitantly triggering expectations about future inflationary trends. Lower rates and easy monetary policy (operating typically at full employment level) would raise inflationary expectations about future. If credit is available easily, it will automatically lead to credit boom and consequently increase in the price level.4-The real rate difference between two countries: when real rates are higher, currencies in those countries will appreciate. Conversely, countries with lower rates will decline in value. This is because foreign and domestic investors will invest in countries with higher real interest rates.5-The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is another interesting theory which states that the cost (price) of all commodities should be equalized across all countries. Currency of country with lower inflation should appreciate against the higher inflation country.6-The balance of payments theory postulates that a country running larger current account balance will face a downward pressure on its currency. During the Asian flu of 1997, the currencies of Asian economies underwent massive depreciation after the number of non-performing loans of local banks (denominated in the US dollar) escalated. Remember Current Account is only one factor in the stability of currency. Other factors also count towards the strength of the local currency. For example, the US has been running deficits for a long period of time, yet the US dollar gains "periodic strength" during economic crisis. This is because US dollar is considered as a safe haven currency.To conclude, these economic theories work only under specific assumptions (conditions) in a perfect world with little or no transaction costs and perfect mobility of capital. In the real world, there are uncountable factors which determine the exchange rate at certain point of time. These theories might work; assuming low transaction costs and other hiccups in the long run. In the short run, macroeconomic indicators are a better barometer for currency valuation.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269840', 1, '2013-03-31 18:51:56', '2014-03-24 23:47:07', 1),
(302, 'The Principles of Austrian Economics', 'The objective of this article is to summarize the principles of economics related to the Austrian school of economics. The Austrian school originated at the University of Vienna by Carl Menger. Today, the Austrian school represents a different perspective from the mainstream economics. The key principles of Austrian school are summarized below:1-Menger was of view that Economics and physical sciences were quite different in so far that the former involved human emotions, which are quite difficult to measure, whereas the latter involved dimensions which can be readily measured.2-The Austrian and Mainstream economics have common views on Margin Utility. People tend to acquire first what gives them the maximum satisfaction; and give up first what gives them the least satisfaction. The measurement of Margin Utility is highly subjective and cannot be quantified easily. It varies from one individual to another.3-Friedrich Hyek and Ludwig Von Mises argued that the booms and busts originate due to injection of money by the policy makers. Driven by greed, the investors make investment decisions. When money is withdrawn and investors realize about wrong investment decisions, consumers pull back and the artificial boom collapses. The state and society may not be right in making decisions. It is the individual who would make choices and decisions. Therefore it is absolutely essential to understand how individuals make their choices (decisions). Economics is highly subjective and is different from other sciences in so far we cannot make direct measurements in economics. All economic decisions are intrinsically subjective and depend on the perception and values of individuals.4-Markets are in a continuous state of flux. The market actors strive for competition to identify gaps, fill these needs and make profits. Competition is a continuous process of discovery.5-Production cannot be re-used in most cases and changes in demand can affect the production process substantially. Production is inherently quite risky.6-Inflation is dangerous for economic stability. Money is like a commodity. If the government circulates more money in the economy, its value dips with the net result of overall increase in the price level. The government and Central Banks by pumping too much money would bring temporary booms only. When things get settled down, the economy recoils back to the real equilibrium but with greater level of inflation.7-Government intervention is not justified, even if it is well-intentioned. Government cannot ascertain precise information at certain point of time. First because individuals keep changing their plans and second it becomes quite different to read the mind and behavior of individuals. The government often makes wrong judgments and distorts equilibrium, which cannot be visible to the policy makers due to complexity of ever changing human perception of values.8-Society as a whole does not have its own collective mind or purpose. It is the individuals who have their own independent minds and not society per se. Economic events emanate from these individual decisions. It is because of the emphasis of the Austrian economics on individual decisions that they do not give much importance to macroeconomics.9-Low interest rates, unfortunately, fuel credit-booms that would motivate investors to invest in wrong places. When the bubble bursts, the waste in the investment process becomes obvious. Moreover with lower interest rates people tend to borrow more from banks, sometimes beyond their capacity. The fractional reserve banking system reinforces this phenomenon. When the artificial trends are reversed, the economy contracts and moves into recession.10-According to Austrian economists, inflation is not defined in terms of rising price level but in terms of increasing money supply. They use the term of "inflationary expansion" generally triggered by the government policies. Most important, the Austrian economists believe that the rise of price index is not accurate barometer of inflation in the economy. Price index is determined by the choice of underlying basket of goods. This choice is arbitrary and will produce different results. One solution could be to peg dollar to a commodity like gold. Unfortunately this is not a practical solution because of "limited amount" of gold in the world. Hayek had suggested the idea of competition among currencies. It is easier said than done. Governments and central banks by the end of day will exercise tight controls to defeat the ideas of competing currencies.To conclude, the Austrian school is more focused on individual behavior and choices. It does not support macroeconomic interventions by the governments, at least in the Keynesian sense of monetary policy management, to keep interest rates low for a long period of time (as happened in the US since 2006). This artificial dampening of rates would eventually fuel temporary credit booms likely to be busted at some stage. The end result is nothing but downturn in the economy, this time perhaps accompanied with soaring prices.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269824', 1, '2013-03-31 18:53:24', '2014-03-24 23:51:36', 1),
(303, 'The Virtue of Staying Invested', 'The objective of this article is to make readers realize that long term investors will benefit from the volatile markets of today.In an era of rapid information movement, markets have developed significant "mood swings". These swings are not driven by "market fundamentals" alone; "news hype" would significantly impact market movements and valuations as well. In other words, there are three key players which affect the modern capital markets: first speculators who attempt to ride the wave of markets in the hope of making short term gains; second conventional financial media which 1es hyped news to attract masses; and third burgeoning social media channels generating democratization of ideas. These three forces in combination with advanced emerging technologies have generated ubiquitous information causing improved efficiency in the global capital markets. This means market fundamentals lag behind these information waves; thereby producing volatility in the global capital markets.The positive news is that regardless of the market environment, investors always find some opportunities for growth. More important, investors profit from this volatility by exercising patience and staying invested in the long term.Investors can weather volatility by adopting following key smoothing strategies:1-Focus on long term strategies while ignoring short term volatility.2-Perform dollar-cost averaging which means buying stocks at different points of time regularly. You buy cheap stocks when markets are down. This is obviously an efficient strategy to average out the cost of purchasing stocks.3-Re-align your portfolio to your specific risk profile. Invest in stocks if you have a higher risk profile, and invest in the fixed income securities if you have lower tolerance for risk.4-Rebalance your portfolio: you need to keep your portfolio (combination of equities and fixed income) balanced; aligning to changing market conditions.5-When everybody is buying stocks and the economy has reached its peak, perhaps it is time to switch to more conservative investing. When market has declined substantially, it might be a good idea to purchase equities and offload bonds and fixed income securities.Following are some examples of outstanding investment opportunities emerging during financial-economic crisis:1-In the period 1929-1932, about 11,000 banks collapsed while the value of stocks declined by over 70%. In the post depression era, some giants like Toyota and Walt Disney emerged.2-The 1970s was a period of high inflation in North America and Europe. This situation was exacerbated by hike in oil prices-both by the 1973 oil embargo crisis as well as the geopolitical turmoil wrought by the Iranian revolution of 1979. During this period, some of the opportunities which emerged were software giant Microsoft and the cell-phones. These technologies have revolutionized the world.3-In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a series of economic recessions which led to failure of more than 1600 banking institutions in the US. Notwithstanding this mass-scale failure of Banks, the financial stability was maintained due to promise of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits. Consequently there was no panic or bank run as was witnessed during the Great Depression. The invention of Internet in the 1990s and the compact discs in the 1980s were some outstanding developments of the period.4-The economic crisis of 2007-2008 has shifted the focus of investment opportunities toward the emerging economies. The potential high growth of big five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) as well as Frontier economies will continue to attract investors for investment in these economies. The rapid flow of information, growth of mobile internet and 3G technologies and emergence of social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) will go a long way in the globalization of investment portfolios.To conclude, global capital markets have become quite efficient due to growth of fast information underpinned by the emerging technologies. This has produced greater volatility though. Successful investors will pick the right investments and stay invested steadfast for reasonable length of time (for example five to seven years). The principle of modern day efficient markets is: rolling stone gathers no moss.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269832', 1, '2013-03-31 18:54:16', '2014-03-24 23:52:42', 1),
(304, 'Active Portfolio Management With ETFs ', 'The intention of active Portfolio Management is to outperform the Market index. Although it is very difficult to outperform the Market index, yet a majority of fund managers try their luck to excel the market index. Active Portfolio Management involves four key strategies:1 - Technical Chartists: They study the price patterns to interpolate future price movements. The chartists use trend lines as well as volume to analyze the price movement of securities. The premise is that history, as depicted by price patterns, repeats itself. Benjamin Graham stated that this approach may be popular but it is fallacious. This is the reason that no chartist has "consistently or lastingly made money."2 - Momentum Investing: It is a strategy to time the markets. Momentum traders see the rising Price and Earnings trend along with associated Volume increases. Momentum is tracked both for the security and the industry. More important, the longer the time period of trend, the better it is for the investors.3 - Top-Down Strategies: These Strategies focus on key Macroeconomic trends; followed by Industry and geographical dynamics; to bet on the movement of ETFs and Securities. This is rather a very difficult approach as nobody can predict the direction of the market; due to hundreds of complex factors involved in the direction and timing of the Business Cycle.4 - Bottom-Up Approach: Warren Buffet and most fundamentalists believe in bottom-up approach. It is basically fundamental analysis, which focuses on Financial earnings, ratio analysis, M&A and other internal as well as external dynamics facing the company.Passive Investing, as the name indicates, focuses on mimicking an index or benchmark; and does not make any changes to the Portfolio except for the purpose of "rebalancing" due to market changes or redemption (cash withdrawal) of funds.The hardest part of a passive investing strategy is to continue to execute faith and not twist investment strategy, in particular when markets are declining against expectations.ETFs provide an excellent vehicle for low cost diversification; but the risk is correlation between different indices as well as underlying securities. Also it makes little sense to invest in two ETFs which are correlated to each other. The two ETFs are not correlated when their returns-risk profile follow a random pattern. However, in the real world, it is very difficult to find underlying assets which are negatively correlated under all circumstances. In particular during periods of high market volatility, correlation between different asset classes increases - this obviously increases the probability of correlation between different ETFs.', 1, '2013-03-31 18:55:04', '2014-03-24 23:41:03', 1),
(305, 'US and the Canadian Housing Markets', 'Introduction:This article examines three key fundamental questions: (1)-Would the US housing market face any reversal given what is happening in the US and global economy? (2)-As predicted by some pundits, would the Canadian economy undergo any serious correction? (3)-What are the key macroeconomic factors which impact the Canadian and the US housing markets? And using this framework what predictions can we make both for short and long term trends of real estate markets?The US Housing Market: Its Evolution from Crisis (2007-2008) to Present:The US housing bubble was created by "Steroids Banking" using "Securitization" process and taking advantage of low interest rates and massive inflow of investment money from abroad. The housing prices in most regions almost doubled 2001 to 2006; and subprime lending escalated astronomically. The private Mortgage banks were applying their creativity and greed in designing highly risky esoteric mortgage products using the "Securitization" process.What is "Securitization"? Put simply this is packaging of mortgages (including subprime) into structured products (Mortgage backed securities, Collateralized debt obligations). The manufacturing mortgage bank then removes these esoteric products from its balance sheets to minimize any risks and sells these products to institutional investors using SIV (Structured investment vehicles). The buyers of these products erroneously assumed that the underlying mortgages of these securities were "safe collateral" given upward trending housing market. However, when subprime mortgages defaulted and housing market began to sink, these structured products built around defaulting mortgages fell sharply in value, thereby freezing the entire global credit system. Added to this turmoil was dilution of commercial paper because of potential default of big lending institutions. The global financial system was under siege. Ironically, the Credit default swaps, which mean to insure against default of these mortgages collapsed under their own weight, thereby reinforcing the Credit crisis. The US Treasury and the Fed intervened and injected trillions of dollars to save the collapsing US Housing and Banking system.This crisis is a classic example of "Moral Hazard" issue. Who was responsible for over-leveraging the system beyond its buoyancy point? Technically the Mortgage banks had packaged the mortgages and passed on the risks to the institutional investors. The institutional investors made the wrong assumption that the US housing market will move North forever. The Fed and other institutions did not have a proper regulatory-monitoring structure as envisioned in the BASEL guidelines to avert such over-leveraging. Nobody knew who will be responsible if the edifice collapses. Worst of all, the institutional investors assumed wrongly that the "Credit default swaps" (CDS) instruments would work miracles; and bail out defaulting mortgages. This is known as Moral hazard problem. Ultimately everybody was looking forward to the Fed and the Treasury to bail out the global financial system from reaching the doomsday.The US Housing Market in the aftermath of Crisis:The "Mortgage Delinquency Rate (MDR)" is a key metric that speaks of the real fallout of the US housing crisis (2007-2008). It measures the percentage change in delinquency of residential loans. In June 2007, the MDR was 2.17% and reached its highest level in March 2011 at 11.36%. It recovered back to 2008 levels at 10.4% recently. MDR is a key lagging indicator that reflects economic difficulties. Another key metric reflecting the state of housing health in the US is the S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index. This is an index reflecting change in housing prices of 20 (and 10) key US metropolitan areas. The home prices in April 2012 for 20-city composite have reached the level existing in the start of 2003. In April 2012, the home prices have declined about 34-35% from its peak level in 2006.The main reason for a stagnant US housing market as evidenced from the MDR data is a fragile labor market. Slow job growth rate is due to weak consumer spending, which is the 70% component of real GDP and key driver of job creation in the US. Consumer spending is directly related to job growth rate, the saving rate and the consumer confidence. In an uncertain environment, spending falls and both the US dollar and saving rate increases. Although savings are recycled by the intermediaries as investments for businesses, this does not necessarily translate onto investment spending and GDP growth. Companies in a high risk environment aim to trim their balance sheets by paying off their debts, a process called as deleveraging. They do not want to burden their balance sheets by borrowing from banks. This deleveraging process slows down the level of investment in the economy thereby indirectly moderating the job growth rate. Deleveraging also runs counterproductive to low interest rates and impedes growth in jobs and therefore fast recovery of real estate prices.Why the Canadian housing market is not poised for a serious correction?The Canadian Mortgage system is more robust and conservative than the one prevailing in the US. First of all, the Canadian subprime market is only 5% of total outstanding mortgages whereas during its peak years 2004-2006, the US subprime market captured 25% of total outstanding US mortgages. The Canadian mortgage system executes better risk management tools including limited exposure to securitization and tight lending practices backed by insurance mortgage. The recent changes in the Mortgage lending have further tightened the belts to avoid any risks to healthy housing in Canada.The supply and demand conditions in Canada are monitored by all players actively. There is a great degree of transparency and authenticity in the housing data and practices. Supply dovetails both current and future demand leaving little room for creation of bubbles. Remember bubbles happen when there is a huge undiscovered lag between supply and demand. For example, there is an anticipated constraint of commercial real estate supply in the wake of surging demand both in Toronto area and Western Canada.A large number of Canadians are currently disillusioned by lower and volatile investment returns in the core financial assets, stocks and bonds. The ongoing volatility in the Capital markets is expected to last in the next few years, given some long lasting problems like risks of Sovereign debt crisis in Europe & the US. This situation has mobilized a great number of people to invest in real estate as most viable alternative investment in the wake of record low interest rates. This process might continue for some years as the core financial assets (stocks, bonds and mutual funds) may not pick up momentum soon.The concept of a bubble is not quite relevant in the context of the Canadian housing market. This is explained in terms of a typical sales cycle witnessed in Toronto and other places in Canada. The sales cycle woven around tighter demand-supply conditions mitigates the probability of bubbles. For example, in Toronto, condos are sold or flipped by investors, who generally do not live in those condos. When interest rates would inch up in future, these investors will find it difficult to keep highly expensive condos. They will sell these condos putting downward pressure on prices of the condominium market. Intuitively, the falling prices will give opportunity to new immigrants and other investors to purchase condos, as they could not previously afford it. This process is further strengthened by different ethnic groups who support their new immigrant friends and families toward the purchase of their first homes in Canada. Overall these processes would push prices upwards again. To conclude, given these tight supply-demand conditions, the chances of any serious correction are quite minimal in Toronto.What are the Macroeconomic factors which impact the prices of Real Estate?Interest Rates and Inflation: Interest rate is the price of money. It is determined by supply and demand of loanable funds. However the country''s Central bank can greatly influence the rate by tightening credit conditions or making those relaxed by pumping money into the system. This is typically done through Monetary Policy and open Market operations. Lower rates make it cheaper for potential buyers to borrow money and make purchases. It also helps current homeowners to refinance their homes and save money. All this will lead to stronger demand for mortgages and housing. Increasing rates will have the opposite effect and dampen the level of sales activity in the Mortgage market.Carry forward trades, borrowing at lower rates in one region and investing it in other, also indirectly impact real estate. For example, foreign institutional investors can borrow money overseas at cheaper rates and invest in Canadian real estate market. More important, real interest rates equal nominal rates minus inflation. Rising level of inflation will lower the real interest rates and declining levels will inflate real rates. Inflation typically feeds into asset prices including real estate. Tightening of money supply is done to control inflation, and this process leads to rising interest rates. Easing of money supply is done to trigger growth and this is accompanied with declining interest rates. However greater supply of money and rising oil prices (supply side) feed into inflation and ultimately inflates asset prices.Economic Growth, Consumer spending and Employment level: Economic growth is measured by growth in the real GDP. Slowdown in economic growth-both global and regional-raises fears of "deflation" or declining prices, which does not bode well with overall economic affluence. Deflation can be compared to freezing of an economy. Japan experienced sustained recession due to deflation for a long period. Fear of deflation due to declining growth can have negative impact on the real estate market.Labor Market dynamics and in particular the level of unemployment has a critical relationship to the health of the housing sector. Rising unemployment during recession is often accompanied with low housing demand and mortgage delinquencies. For example, when Enron crisis erupted, there was general softening in the regional housing market. Another example is the current state of the US housing market. Economists say that the slow pace of housing recovery is attributed to a stagnant US labor market, which is stuck up at over 8% of unemployment rate.Consumer spending plays a key role in the US while the export sector plays an important role in China. As well in Canada, consumer spending has correlation to the GDP growth. In case of the US, Consumer spending constitutes 70% of GDP and is therefore most important driver of GDP growth rate. Higher consumption level, driven by consumer confidence levels, leads to greater economic (job creation) activity and ultimately translates into greater demand for housing. Surging consumer debt, as it is happening in Canada, is also not healthy for a sustainable consumption and GDP growth. Over-leveraged consumers do not have the capacity to absorb shocks like layoffs or increase in interest rates & inflation.Institutional Capacity of Economy to absorb External shocks: The housing crisis of 2007-2008 contaminated the global financial system. The Fed and G-7 countries had to undertake unprecedented bail out measures to save the global financial system from getting derailed. Fortunately, the Canadian housing market was resilient enough to absorb the shocks and did not sink. This happened because of a relatively conservative mortgage system prevailing in Canada. Regulatory measures also impact the resilience of the housing market. For example, tax credits in the US had triggered growth of the housing sector in the aftermath of crisis. Canada has applied its regulations to keep the housing sector strong and healthy.Demographics and Migration: These play an important role in shaping the long term prospects of the real estate market. In Canada and the US, the aging population of baby boomers will create more demand for residential and vacation homes in the next decade. International migration to Canada is also an important determinant of housing market in Canada.Technology, Oil-Commodities boom and Exports: The Canadian economic and housing activity is also impacted by three external forces: Chinese Investors, Oil-commodities prices and economic activity in the US. The Western Canada is impacted by the level of Chinese and foreign investments, mainly in the Mining and Oil sector. The Eastern region, mainly Ontario and Quebec, is impacted by the level of exports to the US and therefore indirectly on the state of the US economy. Stronger Canadian dollar does not augur well for exporters. Overall, the Canadian economy and dollar are strengthened by rising demand for Oil and commodities.National Level of debt: In the US, the national level of debt is reaching about $14 trillion and will continue to grow in the years to come. National debt piles up due to persistent fiscal deficits in the economy. In the US, there is a challenge of twin deficits-both fiscal deficit and external imbalances. The twin deficits not only lead to faster growth of national debt but trigger anticipation of higher interest rates and inflation. This happens through the following mechanism: Higher debt in the US is monetized by either selling bonds to China (or other surplus countries) or by printing money from thin air. In either case it leads to greater risks and consequently higher interest rates, fast depreciating currencies and therefore more inflation. Some economists say that if debt is not contained by the US policy-makers, we may enter an era of hyperinflation where all asset prices (including real estate) will become very costly.Applying Macroeconomic Framework to analyze current & future trends:(I)-Current Global Economic Outlook: The global economic growth is expected to moderate in 2012 (and perhaps 2013). Concomitantly, the global real estate market is cooling down a bit. The moderation in growth is spread unequally across different geographical regions. In the US, which been the central point of housing crisis, there is some improvement in key housing indicators. Given sustained low rates, minimal probability of deflation (freezing of economy) and complete preparations by European Central Bank to cope with Eurozone debt crisis-there is less likelihood of any major reversal to the US economic fundamentals and therefore the housing market.The key emerging Global housing trends are captured in the following summary:(A)-The battered US housing market is relatively stable, with less increase in foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies. The US market is currently an ideal buyers'' market. However, there will be a substantial lag time before we can witness a complete turnaround in the US housing market.(B)-The vibrant Canadian housing market is generally perceived to be ready for some correction in 2012 and 2013. Chart V shows key housing trends in Canada.(C)-The European housing market is (and will in future) undergoing a degree of correction. This stems from recent fiscal crisis in Europe as well as fragility of the German economy exposed recently. The housing market in the emerging global economies is also cooling down a bit.(II)-Some Predictions using the Macroeconomic Framework:The short term perspective of the Canadian housing market might witness come corrections in 2012 and 2013, but as argued in this paper this will be minimal. Also, as argued further, the commercial real estate market will stay steady and strong in 2012 and 2013 in Canada.Given the complex interplay of global economic forces and what is happening in the Eurozone and the US in terms of debt crisis, it is rather difficult to make any certain long term predictions. However, growing complexity warrants a more holistic inter-market analysis to predict about the real estate trends. The seven key global economic trends of the next decade can help us understand the future real estate prospects as well. These seven trends are as follows: (1)-The bubble of Sovereign debt crisis in the US and Europe will last for sometimes, at least next decade. Governments in this part of the world are running unsustainable massive debts, which will ultimately put an upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. (2)-The clear outcome of (1) above will be depreciating value of currencies. (3)-Another consequence of (1) above will be fragile and volatile bonds and stock markets. (4)-Commodities, gold and some alternative investments will become attractive as they will be perceived to store real value. Currencies, stocks and bonds will depreciate fast. (5)-Inflation will be triggered by massive monetization of debt (printing currency from thin air). This situation may be exacerbated if China pulls out trillion of dollars of US bond purchases it made in the last decade; and if oil prices continue to move north. (6)-Demographic trends entail growth of baby boomers in North America and Europe leading to migration to North America. (7)-The US dollar will not evaporate because of spectacular performance of the US companies and technological advancement in North America.Given these seven key economic trends of the next decade, the housing market will stay vibrant and steady in Canada and the US. Baby boomers, foreign investors and immigrants will continue to play a critical role in strengthening the housing demand in North America. Hyperinflation, as worst case scenario, might pull down demand of assets because it would stoke prices of those assets including real estate. At this stage, however, it cannot be predicted whether the European and the US governments will take concrete measures to contain their debts and put in place sustainable debt management policies. Future events will unravel the political commitment of these governments. At this stage, one thing is certain: the current debt monetization policy of these governments is not sustainable in the long run.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7252107', 1, '2013-03-31 18:57:58', '2014-03-24 23:53:59', 1);

(312, 'A Primer on Stock Investing (Part 1)', 'The objective of this article is to summarize some key metrics of stock investments and valuation; and help investors make informed decisions using a relatively simple framework.There has been a plethora of information on stock investing, regularly bombarded on investors by financial media. This flood of information is disseminated by multiple media channels. Some of these industry resources provide valuable information, yet these reports may not help in making informed decisions. Studies have shown that Value line, with its highly sophisticated analysis, can hardly compete with the Market index. Research has demonstrated that beating the Market index needs "superior" analysis and right timed execution. The term used for this unique skill is Alpha; and some examples of Alpha seeking Gurus are Warren Buffet, George Soros, Peter Lynch and others.Before delving into a more pragmatic framework of stocks, it is important to define different categories of stock investing. Stocks are broadly categorized as either common stocks or preferred stocks. The key difference between the two is characterized by the following. First, preferred stocks are preferred, as the name implies, over common stocks in terms of claim by the shareholders in case of default by the company. Second, preferred stocks are purchased to get dividends (income) with less potential for appreciation; while common stocks may be used for both dividends as well as capital appreciation, with focus on the latter. Third, preferred stocks behave like bonds in some cases, as interest rates go up the price of preferred would typically go down. Interest rate variation has some degree of correlation with stock market as a whole because as interest rates go up the stock market gets hit. For individual common stocks, interest rate variation effects will depend on a number of factors, in particular the capital (or debt) structure of the firm.Other categories of common stocks include: First blue chip stocks of well reputed Dow Jones companies with established history of dividends payments to investors. Second, value stocks are under-valued gems, likely to grow in the long run. Third, growth stocks as the name implies are growth oriented stocks which are priced higher because of their perception of appreciation in future. Fourth, cyclical stocks which are sensitive to swings in the business cycles. And fifth, stocks which stay calm during market swings such as Utilities.The key metrics of stock investing are summarized below:1-52 Weeks High-Low: Find out the price of the stocks prevailing in the stock market and compare the current price to past 52 weeks of high and low prices of the same stock. The idea is simple: stocks having lower price range in the rising markets have greater upward potential than stocks which have already reached high 52 week mark.2-Market Capitalization: This metric reflects how big the company is. Market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding of the company by the prevailing market price. Typically stocks are classified as large cap, mid-cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks, like Exxon, generally do not have a great upward potential of price increase as compared to some gems in the category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The latter category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks has the highest probability of representing emerging star investments, which typically multiply and grow ten-fold in a certain time period.3-Volume: This metric tells us how much dollars are being traded on a single day. Volume is computed by multiplying number of stocks in trading on a particular day by the average price. Blue chip stocks like Exxon, Microsoft and Apple have larger volume. In contrast, small and mid-cap stocks have smaller volume, thereby creating some liquidity risk.4-Earnings growth (past and future): This is a key metric which determines the price of stocks. Earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the earnings of the company by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings growth (year over year YOY) is important from two angles: whether earnings have grown in the past five years; and whether actual earnings have exceeded the predicted earnings in the current year. The performance of growth companies particularly is judged by the corresponding growth of earnings. Interestingly earnings per share is diluted by the issuance of more shares; or conversion of fixed income securities onto common stocks. This action would decrease the value of EPS. In contrast, if a company buys back its shares, the earnings per share would increase proportionately. For example, if a company, abundant in cash reserves, buys back half of its shares, the EPS would arithmetically double, making it more attractive to the stock investors. Remember EPS is strongly correlated to the price of stock. Consequently, buying back stocks and assuming that the external factors do not change can eventually lead to increase in the price of stocks.5-Price to earnings (P/E) ratio: Despite the fact that this ratio has some caveats, P/E is the most popular ratio in the world of stock investing. P/E ratio is simply the current price of stock divided by the 12 months trailing earnings (although analysts sometimes use 12 months of forecasted earnings as well). Growth investors would like growth in earnings regardless of the direction of the price of stock. Conversely, the value investors want to see declining P/E ratio in order to hunt for the undervalued gems. Value investors typically go after companies whose earnings growth rate is higher than the P/E ratio. The second metric admired by the value investors is the existence of the current P/E ratio falling below the past five year average.6-Price to Sales (P/S): There is general perception that sometimes companies would twist accounting methods in order to manipulate earnings. It is rather difficult to apply such manipulation to the sales numbers. This metric throws light on how much money you are willing to pay for the sales generated by the company. For growth companies, this number should continue to be smaller. However growth investors will not care much about this ratio as compared to value investors. The value investors would like to see this ratio lower.7-Price to Book ratio (P/B): The book value means how much a company is worth if it was liquidated today. The price to book ratio is a simple comparison of stock''s price to net asset value of the company. The main caveat is that this metric focuses on tangible assets of the company. Investment research has revealed that intangibles also play a very significant role in the value creation for the shareholders. It is for this reason that P/B ratio is not a comprehensive metric.8-Value creation and growth metrics: Most stock analysts typically focus on EPS (Earnings per share) metric for the past five years. Although earnings and sales are like life bloodline of a company, yet basing stock investing decisions on earnings (and sales) standalone can be misleading. More specifically, the analyst should undertake more detailed analysis of the following three key areas that determine the earnings (sales) of the company eventually:a-The quality of revenue earned by the company and transparency (compliance standards) of revenue recognition. What are the growth prospects of the company?b-The net profit margin or quality of earnings: what is the strategy of a company to optimize costs and increase return on investments? Of course, management plays a critical to enhance the size and quality of earnings.c-What is the position of cash flows? It is important to purchase stocks of companies with positive cash flows.9-Dividend Yield: This metric is generally relevant for large blue chip companies, such as those constituting the Dow Jones Industrial average. It is less relevant for small and high growth companies, because these companies hardly declare any dividends. Some investors, depending on their risk profile and investment goals will prefer large companies churning dividends consistently.10-Relative Price Strength: This metric compares last year price performance of stocks within a congruent group. Similar comparison between stock siblings is made for Earnings per share. This type of analysis is typically done by Investor''s Business Daily.11-Return on Equity (ROE): is an important metric, which explains how much money the company is making at the behest of the shareholders'' equity. In simple terms, it elucidates whether the company is efficiently utilizing resources at its disposal and is making profit. This metric is particularly relevant for growth investors. Growth companies should keep track of Return on Equity (ROE) to ensure that the growth projects are generating positive net present value (NPV). The ROE metric clearly speaks of the depth and competency of the management.12-Insider Ownership: It is generally argued that the larger size of the insider ownership is a better indicator of the success of a company. This proposition makes sense because when owners are stakeholders, they would work hard to push the company to success. However this metric standalone cannot indicate the strength of a company. There could be periods when stakeholders would sell stocks to generate money from their changing personal and business needs.13-Forecast on Company''s performance: Value of a company is not based on its past performance. This is because past performance is only relevant to the extent that it can help analysts make some predictions about future trends and growth. However, there is no guarantee that the external environment would stay the same and that the company would repeat its past performance. Equally difficult is the forecast (predictions) about future earnings and revenues of the company. Investors should complete their own due diligence to analyze the possibility of meeting actual earnings and revenue goals.14-Integrity and Depth of Management: This is perhaps the most important metric to make an assessment about the future performance and direction of any company. Performance is a relative term; and will vary depending on the nature of company. For example, from the viewpoint of growth companies, performance is defined by year over year (YOY) growth while maintaining positive return on equity (ROE). For technology companies, performance is underpinned by successful launch of innovation in the guise of new product introductions. The caveat is that innovation is difficult to measure because of its rolling into both tangible and intangible domains. How can you, for example, measure the success or long term value of Apple iphones? The ubiquitous existence of disruptive technologies makes this task even harder. Overall, the depth, maturity and commitment of management is the most important metric to judge the future performance of a company.15-Volatility of Stocks: This metric is absolutely critical in making decisions about the Risk-Return profile of the investor. Put simply, volatility is a measure of how much returns deviate from the average value in a given period of time. Greater volatility implies greater risk. Volatility tends to be higher in the short run and would smooth out to some extent in the long run. Of course, volatility depends on the correlation of stock price to market swings (called as Beta).To conclude, the above framework must be analyzed in a holistic manner. Again these metrics, when combined together, will be viewed differently by the value and growth investors. The value investor would be focused on long term competitive advantage, reputation of brand and relative current valuation of the company. On the other hand, the growth investor will care about past and future growth patterns regardless of 52 week price fluctuations and growth potential (revenue generation) of the company.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7284136', 1, '2013-03-31 18:45:10', '2013-03-31 18:45:10', 0),
(313, 'European and US Debt Crisis', 'Ironically the US Treasuries always gain strength in an uncertain economic environment, despite Credit downgrading of the US Treasury bonds. Why? The US Treasuries, despite some serious Debt implications, are still viewed by the Markets as much safer and risk free instruments. In my opinion, the European debt issue is far from over - there are some countries which have over-leveraged Debt to GDP ratios; Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Italy to name few.What we need to discern is a subtle difference between the US and the European debt issues. These issues may sound similar, but they are quite different both in terms of economic scope and political underpinnings. The US debt, undoubtedly, is a long term challenge as demonstrated by a marked increase in the spread between the yields of Ten year Notes and the corresponding Inflation Protected Treasury securities. The economics is quite simple: more deficit means greater debt; more debt implies higher rates and inflationary pressures; and if they are out of balance this would result in currency crisis, massive devaluations and disturbance of global financial balance.The European debt is a more complicated issue, at least from the standpoint of the geo-economic structure. The US debt issue, notwithstanding the massive size of debt touching $13 trillion plus, is manageable in so far the government apparatus and the Fed are well positioned to attend to any unexpected movement of debt limits. This may not be the case for the European Union - which is facing a dilemma of aligning political and economic interests. For instance, if Greece were to default and its debt restructured, it would relinquish membership of the European Union. Why? Because its currency will have to undergo massive devaluations to re-align the backlog of its horrendous debt and put the house in order again. This is not possible while its strings are attached to the European Central Bank. Ironically this guaranteed cushion by the European Central Bank might promote moral hazard for countries to take on debt and buy time. Such an eventuality might trigger a more serious crisis at a later stage; the solution lies in both short term injection of capital and long term scrutiny to ward-off risks to overleveraged economies.The Fed has deployed unprecedented quantitative easing in history, by utilizing $2.86 trillion Balance Sheet, in order to keep the short term interest rates to near zero level. Remember the Fed has already injected a mammoth dose of $2.3 trillion into the Financial System since the collapse of Lehman Holdings in September 2008. The probability of the Fed continuing this stance of keeping rates on lower end would most likely continue; the key drivers are the slumping Mortgage Insurance and ailing housing markets. Any increase in rates would put unbearable pressure on $914.4 billion of Mortgage-backed debt of the Fed. Concomitantly, the Obama administration is struggling to close massive federal budget deficit of $2 to $4 trillion.In this environment, Treasuries are most likely to rebound in the short term; while yields on Treasury Inflation Protected (TIPS) would escalate in the long term. In my viewpoint, an unstoppable escalation of this "spread" between the two (which would run somewhat parallel to an inverted yield curve) would signal potential threat to the Global economy. Here is the "economics story" behind this key trend witnessed recently:1. Burgeoning Fiscal deficit would prop up the National debt of the US, unless domestic Savings are capable enough to fill the gap - which is not the case.2. Deficits and National debts cannot go beyond certain threshold, without inflicting damage to the economic balance. This is true in case of the US as well although the Fed can print dollars literally from the "thin air" as long as it wants to do so.3. If debt exceeds permissible limits, the first thing to be hit will be the interest rates. Higher rates will cause insurmountable burden on debt servicing as well as dampen consumer demand. Note Consumer spending, impacted directly by the strength of the housing market, is the main driver of GDP growth in the US.4. Higher rates will prove detrimental to a very fragile housing market, which is already facing pressures from an ailing Mortgage Insurance market (a new emerging trend).5. Remember that any quantitative easing by the Fed will keep rates low in the short run; but will come at a cost of burgeoning National debt and consequent expectations about inflations in the future.6. Bonds (Treasuries as well as Debentures) move in an opposite direction to interest rates. Future expectations of lower yields would mean higher price (compensation) for Bonds.7. Finally, interest rates and inflation would move hand in gloves. In this game, expectations are the key determinant of any future play out. Markets are driven by psychological factors - greed and fear - as much as by fundamental factors. In my viewpoint, presently the psychological factors, fear in particular, have masked the "fundamentals" to a great extent. The solution lies in a firm commitment of the Fed and the Government to keep the Fiscal deficits and the National Debts within a plausible limit of the GDP.Last but not least, China is playing a very critical role in maintaining "global financial balance" - it is holding trillions of dollars and Euros of debt; and pumping its exports onto the US and the European Markets. Hefty "consumerism" of Chinese products in the US and Europe is extremely important to keep China churning its exports - any reversal can strain this delicate "financial balance" immensely.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7297693', 1, '2013-03-31 18:43:58', '2013-03-31 18:43:58', 0),
(314, 'Active Portfolio Management With ETFs', 'The intention of active Portfolio Management is to outperform the Market index. Although it is very difficult to outperform the Market index, yet a majority of fund managers try their luck to excel the market index. Active Portfolio Management involves four key strategies:1 - Technical Chartists: They study the price patterns to interpolate future price movements. The chartists use trend lines as well as volume to analyze the price movement of securities. The premise is that history, as depicted by price patterns, repeats itself. Benjamin Graham stated that this approach may be popular but it is fallacious. This is the reason that no chartist has "consistently or lastingly made money."2 - Momentum Investing: It is a strategy to time the markets. Momentum traders see the rising Price and Earnings trend along with associated Volume increases. Momentum is tracked both for the security and the industry. More important, the longer the time period of trend, the better it is for the investors.3 - Top-Down Strategies: These Strategies focus on key Macroeconomic trends; followed by Industry and geographical dynamics; to bet on the movement of ETFs and Securities. This is rather a very difficult approach as nobody can predict the direction of the market; due to hundreds of complex factors involved in the direction and timing of the Business Cycle.4 - Bottom-Up Approach: Warren Buffet and most fundamentalists believe in bottom-up approach. It is basically fundamental analysis, which focuses on Financial earnings, ratio analysis, M&A and other internal as well as external dynamics facing the company.Passive Investing, as the name indicates, focuses on mimicking an index or benchmark; and does not make any changes to the Portfolio except for the purpose of "rebalancing" due to market changes or redemption (cash withdrawal) of funds.The hardest part of a passive investing strategy is to continue to execute faith and not twist investment strategy, in particular when markets are declining against expectations.ETFs provide an excellent vehicle for low cost diversification; but the risk is correlation between different indices as well as underlying securities. Also it makes little sense to invest in two ETFs which are correlated to each other. The two ETFs are not correlated when their returns-risk profile follow a random pattern. However, in the real world, it is very difficult to find underlying assets which are negatively correlated under all circumstances. In particular during periods of high market volatility, correlation between different asset classes increases - this obviously increases the probability of correlation between different ETFs.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7003524', 1, '2013-03-31 18:55:04', '2013-03-31 18:55:04', 0),
(315, 'European Debt Crisis', 'In this article, I plan to highlight seven key issues faced by Europe currently, which could have a formidable impact on the European and Global Financial Systems in future. The key repercussion of this escalating European and the US debt will be: 1-Weaker capacity of governments to deal with future crisis; 2-Deteriorating impact on currencies and paper money; 3-High Inflation expectations which will drive demand of gold; 4-Pressure on governments of developed countries to attend to the needs of a growing population of the baby boomers; and 5-Incapacity of Central Banks to keep the interest rates lower.Issue One: The documentation of Current Accounts (and the Economy) and its effective auditing never prevailed in some of the European countries, notably in Greece. The clear manifestation of this loophole can be found in the ongoing Greek crisis. Nobody could predict that the problem could assume such horrendous dimensions. Who has the right accounting record to fathom the magnitude of problem even today?Issue Two: The European Central Bank (ECB) did not design a robust fire-fighting mechanism to cope with the highly indebted European countries. The member states built massive debts on their balance sheets. This is also part of the Moral Hazard issue which means not to act so responsibly in the hope of getting bailed out ultimately.Issue Three: Mass Psychology and Program Trading can exacerbate the situation in an uncertain environment. The Greek debt crisis had a snowball effect on debt securities of Spain and Italy. The credit spread for their bonds has increased in the past six months. As a result, these heavily indebted countries have fallen into a vicious trap on account of increased debt and ensuing risks to the economy. Logically, increased riskiness leads to hike in interest rates, which dampens the economy and stock markets. For ECB, this implies worsening of already deteriorated balance sheet.Issue Four: Politics cannot be divorced from Economic Policy. The current austerity measures tailored by the Greek government would always face resistance from its people. Social and political divergence in Europe, rooted in rich historical traditions, would always lead to weaker implementation of the Structural Adjustment Plans - a recipe practiced by the IMF in emerging economies for many decades.Issue Five: Germany, with a stable and a strong economy, remains as a leader and role model in Europe. Yet it does not have a well-designed mechanism or political influence to facilitate reforms in other members of the ECB - of course using ECB as a bastion of reforms. Divergent European economies are more sensitive to imposition of external solutions, let alone emulating the economic accomplishments of Germany in the post-unification era.Issue Six: Economists never analyze Debt in isolation, neither for companies nor for countries. For economies, it is benchmarked to real GDP growth. Stringent fiscal measures can muster some discipline in the short run; yet in the long run this would dampen the recession further. Using the analogy of a household it might be a good idea to curtail expenditure; better still would be to generate greater income and budget it for rainy days!Issue Seven: Most important of all, the European debt solution is a long term struggle given both the complexity of issues; and typical fiscal policy time-lags. Imposition of austerity measures unilaterally can sink Europe (already in recession) into deflation, witnessed by Japan in the 1990s. Deflation, defined as persistent decrease in price level, is detrimental to the growth of economy and the stock markets. The solution to avoid Deflation rests on a three pronged strategy: 1-Building fiscal discipline in highly indebted European countries; 2-Designing a painless exit strategy of defaulting economies in order to avoid complete crumbling of the European Monetary Union; and 3-Creating a powerful external mechanism that would stimulate the moribund European economies.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7297662', 1, '2013-03-31 18:42:30', '2013-03-31 18:42:30', 0);

(348, 'Retirement risks in the context of key global and demographic changes, ', 'The objective of this article is to put retirement risks in the perspective of key global trends and changes. The economic collapse of 2008 left us pondering on the key question: can we control the timing of retirement? This event demonstrated the fact that the new economic realities warrant a great bullet proof strategy for retirement. The key risk faced by majority of baby boomers boils down to: would they be able to retire on time in an investment world awash with volatility and unpredictable markets?The key risk is longevity:With medical advancement, your risk of mortality is much lower. In contrast, your risks of morbidity and longevity are much higher. Recent statistics point out that the average male lives to 76 and the average woman lives to 82. It is no surprise that these figures will improve in future as medical technology makes advance strides.Health costs should be tied to retirement:The risk of death has decreased but the risk of not living healthy has ironically increased. Again statistics point out that 1 in 3 Canadians will get some type of critical disease. Health costs are increasing and so is the incidence of viral and bacterial diseases. The health systems are constrained by domestic demands and the latest trends point to global solutions to circumvent long wait times. All this points to an ever increasing health bill? How do you cover yourself under two different conditions? First you could be confronted by a temporary disability which does not let you work. Second, you could be confronted with an unexpected medical emergency, including major surgery or treatment. In this case, your need is not to replace the temporarily lost income but to get an appropriate lump sum payment for the treatment. In the world of insurance, the former case is of disability insurance and the latter points to critical insurance.Insuring against disability or critical insurance is absolutely critical. Why? If you do not have adequate protection, you will dip into your savings, including RRSP, to get money. This could be very costly if you cash out any portion of your RRSP due to serious tax implications. Any retirement plan must hedge the risks of health care costs by creating a contingency plan or buying disability and/or critical insurance.Procrastination and retirementRecent statistics have revealed that 2/3 of Canadians aiming to retire by 2030 are not contributing substantial money to actualize their retirement goals. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the only thing certain in the next decade is uncertainty of the capital markets. Investing without any financial advice can lead to a badly structured portfolio. This would gravitate into procrastination of retirement. What are some other factors which lead to misjudgements about the timings of retirement?- Reliance on the Canada pension plan and old age security is not a good idea; and conservative analysis would typically exclude CPP from calculation of pensions.- Most employees have historically moved from defined benefit towards defined contribution model; which puts more responsibility on the potential retirees than the company itself.- You don’t pay yourself first and therefore not maximize RRSP.- Demographics play an important role in shaping the retirement industry. The surge of baby boomers ahead will underscore demand for capital preservation amidst highly volatile capital markets. The key challenge is volatility and the main need is preservation of capital. Investors will demand downside risk management as much as returns. The ensuing volatility stems from three key factors: First, the low interest rate has created potential bubbles. Second, huge sovereign debt would cause macroeconomic instability. Third, the shift from the US to BRIC countries will be accompanied with increased volatility of capital markets.Most retirees don’t have the expertise and bandwidth to put their retirement goals in the perspective of key global trends. The economic crisis of 2008 emanating from the real estate bubble and mushroom growth of highly leveraged esoteric products points to the fact how fragile the world economy is.The world is undergoing a sharp structural change. Global trade is most probably poised to shrink in the next decade due to three key factors: first, China and India will lead the way for strong economic and population growth as well as robust savings rates which together will help these nations build an internal mechanism of demand for their exports. This will reduce dependence on Europe and the US to absorb exports from China and India. Second, rising energy and commodity prices will reduce mobility of trade goods and localize most factors of production. Third, labor costs in developing high growth economies will rise leading to less advantage to outsourcing many of these services.Another key demographic trend is $3.7 trillion baby boomers industry in Canada which will dampen purchase of stocks in the next decade. Also, the lower level of consumer spending will dilute GDP growth.The best case scenario is underpinned by sideways volatile stock markets driven by persistent demand for the dividends stocks. The worst case scenario is deflation of the economy due to the busting of various bubbles like housing, oil, gold and stock market. The latter will keep the bond market afloat while shifting the centre of gravity to emerging markets fixed income securities.China and India will rise as significant economic powers in future. Their stocks will perform stronger than that of the US. This will do one thing for sure: drive up the prices of energy based commodities and natural resources. This would have positive impact on the economies of Canada and Australia.The retirement risk is the key riskThe key risk for a great number of Canadians is the retirement risk itself. They are shy to put money in the markets with the fear of losing money. As pointed out by the data of statistics Canada, this inaction has resulted into $491 billion of unused RRSP contributions. This situation could be exacerbated by four alarming trends. First, the surge of baby boomers will greatly strain the government sources of help like the CPP. Second, employers are putting responsibility on their employees. Third, stock markets can potentially stay volatile and sideways due to great demographic transition in North America and the BRIC countries. Fourth, persistent low interest rate will create more bubbles which will only lend more volatility to the markets. The worst form of this instability could potentially lead into hyperinflation as the money supply continues to grow unabated.Prudent course of actionThere could be many strategies to retire wisely. Here is a recap of four key strategies:1. Diversification is the key area of focus. You must diversify across geographical areas, stocks &amp; bonds as well as variety of assets for retirement.2. Hedge against volatility in the stock markets. Apply 60/40 rule of investing 60% in equities and the remaining 40% in stocks.3. Create alternative assets. For example, combine real estate investments to permanent insurance strategies and create a powerful combination which does three things: first, permanent insurance as a conservative investment balances your aggressive portfolio. Second, it allows tax-advantaged build-up of cash reserves inside your policy; and potentially hedges any risks of downturn in your real estate holdings. Third, permanent insurance while diversifying your portfolio also ensures efficient transfer of estate to the designated beneficiaries. Specifically, it covers loses from taxes and probate which cut onto the value of estate during estate transfer to beneficiaries; as well as hedges risks against creditors.4. Cover up longevity risks by creating diversified assets. For example, if you have exhausted your retirement funds by age 65, you run the risk of longevity and living through the age of 85. How do you live in those twenty years, in particular when health costs are increasing as well? One potential solution is a combination of permanent life insurance and critical insurance. The former can build cash value to attend to the longevity risk while the latter can take care of unexpected medical emergencies most likely to occur in old age.', 1, '2013-06-05 03:25:49', '2014-06-15 14:51:01', 1),

(354, 'Fixed income ETFs ', 'Fixed income ETFs securities serve two purposes: these are sources of income and balance out portfolio invested into equities. Recently, the fixed investments market has grown exponentially due to depressed interest rates, as corporate companies have leveraged their balance sheets using cheaper rates. The fixed investments market is many times the size of the equity market.Fixed income securities are of different types: treasuries, mortgage backed securities (MBS), money markets, municipal bonds. Different ETFs track these types of fixed income securities. Fixed income securities have many risks with major ones as duration and credit risk. The advantage of using ETFs is low cost exposure to a spectrum of fixed investments, while circumventing risks associated with individual securities.The credit risk is represented by worthiness of the issuing entity. It is generally evaluated by its credit rating done by Standard &amp; Poor and Moody’s. Debt issued by the US Government has no credit risk, although credit rating agencies downgraded the US bonds in the recent past.The second key factor is maturity, or the time it takes to redeem the Principal of bond. Duration is the quantitative measure of sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes. Two factors shape duration of bonds: coupon rate and maturity. Smaller coupons and longer maturity would increase duration, keeping other factors constant. Larger duration implies greater sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes. One key term in assessing fixed securities space is the credit spread. The key question is: what extra yield I am getting as compared to risk free rate, for assuming the extra risk?

The investment advisor combines different asset classes to produce optimal mix corresponding to risk tolerance and objectives of the investors. Some advisors are also adding commodities and real estate assets to the portfolio. The key advantage is that these asset classes, commodities and real estate, are not correlated to equities and fixed income. High net worth individuals also add hedge funds and private equity. Equity exposure has three key components which are discussed below: (A) sector or industry, (B) style (value vs. growth), and (C) geography.Sectors or industry could be categorized into many areas such as resources, materials, telecoms, utilities, industrials, financials, technology, health care, etc. Industries can be divided into sub categories. For example, healthcare could be divided into pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and environment. Generally, many ETFs exist which cover complete industry (Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF) or specific financial sector covered by REITs.The key factors to be considered when purchasing equity ETFs are: expense ratios, lower P/E and P/CF ratios and higher dividend yields. Investment styles constitute second key dimension of equity risks. The first investment style relates to market capitalization (defined as the number of shares outstanding time price). The three categories are large cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. Diamonds, tracking 30 companies of DOW-JONES is on one end and Russell 1000 tracking one thousand names by market cap is on the other end of the spectrum.Equity ETFs, like stocks, can also be categorized into value or growth ETFs. Growth and value ETFs are made up of S&amp;P and Russell indices. Examples of growth ETFs are: the iShares Russell midcap growth index fund (IJK) and the iShares Russell midcap growth index fund (IWP). There are also corresponding value funds which are more liquid than growth funds. Value investing is based on the premise that over the long haul, undervalued ETFs with relatively low price to earnings and price to cash flow will garner superior returns. According to one study, between 1979 and 2003, the Russell 1000 value index posted 14.5% returns versus 12.5% for the growth index.Finally equity ETFs can be chosen on the basis of geographical spread. It is important to note that global macroeconomic trends like currency movements, energy and commodities prices and supply-demand shocks can play an important role in determining the risk-return parameters of global ETFs. Most important, the global ETFs help in tapping long term growth benefits of the emerging economies. For example, Russia and Brazil are leveraged to commodities, India anchored to IT and China linked to manufacturing. These also help in diversification, which is a critical factor in the absence of a superior piece of valuable information.', 1, '2013-09-29 20:56:25', '2014-06-15 14:47:37', 1),
(358, 'The Nature of ETFs ', 'Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) provide a tool for building well diversified portfolios in a cost-effective way. Like index funds, ETFs would replicate the holdings of the underlying index in exact proportions. The ETFs, unlike Mutual Funds, do not have a tracking error; but exactly mimic the returns of the index which it mirrors. Index funds do carry management fees like their counterpart Mutual Funds but in many cases is 1/3rd of the active Mutual Funds. In addition to brokerage commission, there are also spread costs (Bid-Ask) which reflect the liquidity of the ETFs.Index funds, like Mutual Funds, are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), and no matter when you place order during the day, you’ll get the closing price. In contrast, ETFs can be traded on the stock market unlike mutual funds, whether active or index. Interestingly, ETFs do not charge ‘loads’ like mutual funds, just the brokerage commission. One other cost associated with ETFs like Stocks is the Slippage cost, because in tight markets, it is hard to get best price execution.Finally ETFs are transparent in real time and you get to know where you are investing. For mutual funds, you get to know of holdings only at certain regular timings. One reason for the exponential growth of ETFs has been the relative ease with which it can be created.

Why? Because SPDRs provide more efficient exposure to S&amp;P 500 index in terms of liquidity, costs &amp; speed of execution. Optimism leads to an upward pressure on the prices of SPDR and pessimism depresses the price level. In either case, the institutional investors who can circumvent the transaction costs can undertake arbitrage opportunities to profit from these temporary deviations of the SPDR values from their underlying anchor of S&amp;P 500 index. It is easy for the institutional investors to pump millions of dollars &amp; drive economies of scale that cannot be reaped by the individual investors. More important, they can make ‘directionless’ bets by going both long and short, and extracting positive spread out of it. As a result, the institutional arbitrage will balance the SPDR price close to the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the S&amp;P 500 index.

The key implication of this radical global transition is emergence of the powerful emerging Asian economies, China and India in particular.

(766, 'A Primer on Stock Investing (Part 1) ', 'The objective of this article is to summarize some key metrics of stock investments and valuation; and help investors make informed decisions using a relatively simple framework.There has been a plethora of information on stock investing, regularly bombarded on investors by financial media. This flood of information is disseminated by multiple media channels. Some of these industry resources provide valuable information, yet these reports may not help in making informed decisions. Studies have shown that Value line, with its highly sophisticated analysis, can hardly compete with the Market index. Research has demonstrated that beating the Market index needs "superior" analysis and right timed execution. The term used for this unique skill is Alpha; and some examples of Alpha seeking Gurus are Warren Buffet, George Soros, Peter Lynch and others.Before delving into a more pragmatic framework of stocks, it is important to define different categories of stock investing. Stocks are broadly categorized as either common stocks or preferred stocks. The key difference between the two is characterized by the following. First, preferred stocks are preferred, as the name implies, over common stocks in terms of claim by the shareholders in case of default by the company. Second, preferred stocks are purchased to get dividends (income) with less potential for appreciation; while common stocks may be used for both dividends as well as capital appreciation, with focus on the latter. Third, preferred stocks behave like bonds in some cases, as interest rates go up the price of preferred would typically go down. Interest rate variation has some degree of correlation with stock market as a whole because as interest rates go up the stock market gets hit. For individual common stocks, interest rate variation effects will depend on a number of factors, in particular the capital (or debt) structure of the firm.Other categories of common stocks include: First blue chip stocks of well reputed Dow Jones companies with established history of dividends payments to investors. Second, value stocks are under-valued gems, likely to grow in the long run. Third, growth stocks as the name implies are growth oriented stocks which are priced higher because of their perception of appreciation in future. Fourth, cyclical stocks which are sensitive to swings in the business cycles. And fifth, stocks which stay calm during market swings such as Utilities.The key metrics of stock investing are summarized below:1-52 Weeks High-Low: Find out the price of the stocks prevailing in the stock market and compare the current price to past 52 weeks of high and low prices of the same stock. The idea is simple: stocks having lower price range in the rising markets have greater upward potential than stocks which have already reached high 52 week mark.2-Market Capitalization: This metric reflects how big the company is. Market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding of the company by the prevailing market price. Typically stocks are classified as large cap, mid-cap and small cap stocks. Large cap stocks, like Exxon, generally do not have a great upward potential of price increase as compared to some gems in the category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The latter category of mid-cap and small-cap stocks has the highest probability of representing emerging star investments, which typically multiply and grow ten-fold in a certain time period.3-Volume: This metric tells us how much dollars are being traded on a single day. Volume is computed by multiplying number of stocks in trading on a particular day by the average price. Blue chip stocks like Exxon, Microsoft and Apple have larger volume. In contrast, small and mid-cap stocks have smaller volume, thereby creating some liquidity risk.4-Earnings growth (past and future): This is a key metric which determines the price of stocks. Earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the earnings of the company by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings growth (year over year YOY) is important from two angles: whether earnings have grown in the past five years; and whether actual earnings have exceeded the predicted earnings in the current year. The performance of growth companies particularly is judged by the corresponding growth of earnings. Interestingly earnings per share is diluted by the issuance of more shares; or conversion of fixed income securities onto common stocks. This action would decrease the value of EPS. In contrast, if a company buys back its shares, the earnings per share would increase proportionately. For example, if a company, abundant in cash reserves, buys back half of its shares, the EPS would arithmetically double, making it more attractive to the stock investors. Remember EPS is strongly correlated to the price of stock. Consequently, buying back stocks and assuming that the external factors do not change can eventually lead to increase in the price of stocks.5-Price to earnings (P/E) ratio: Despite the fact that this ratio has some caveats, P/E is the most popular ratio in the world of stock investing. P/E ratio is simply the current price of stock divided by the 12 months trailing earnings (although analysts sometimes use 12 months of forecasted earnings as well). Growth investors would like growth in earnings regardless of the direction of the price of stock. Conversely, the value investors want to see declining P/E ratio in order to hunt for the undervalued gems. Value investors typically go after companies whose earnings growth rate is higher than the P/E ratio. The second metric admired by the value investors is the existence of the current P/E ratio falling below the past five year average.6-Price to Sales (P/S): There is general perception that sometimes companies would twist accounting methods in order to manipulate earnings. It is rather difficult to apply such manipulation to the sales numbers. This metric throws light on how much money you are willing to pay for the sales generated by the company. For growth companies, this number should continue to be smaller. However growth investors will not care much about this ratio as compared to value investors. The value investors would like to see this ratio lower.7-Price to Book ratio (P/B): The book value means how much a company is worth if it was liquidated today. The price to book ratio is a simple comparison of stock''s price to net asset value of the company. The main caveat is that this metric focuses on tangible assets of the company. Investment research has revealed that intangibles also play a very significant role in the value creation for the shareholders. It is for this reason that P/B ratio is not a comprehensive metric.8-Value creation and growth metrics: Most stock analysts typically focus on EPS (Earnings per share) metric for the past five years. Although earnings and sales are like life bloodline of a company, yet basing stock investing decisions on earnings (and sales) standalone can be misleading. More specifically, the analyst should undertake more detailed analysis of the following three key areas that determine the earnings (sales) of the company eventually:a-The quality of revenue earned by the company and transparency (compliance standards) of revenue recognition. What are the growth prospects of the company?b-The net profit margin or quality of earnings: what is the strategy of a company to optimize costs and increase return on investments? Of course, management plays a critical to enhance the size and quality of earnings.c-What is the position of cash flows? It is important to purchase stocks of companies with positive cash flows.9-Dividend Yield: This metric is generally relevant for large blue chip companies, such as those constituting the Dow Jones Industrial average. It is less relevant for small and high growth companies, because these companies hardly declare any dividends. Some investors, depending on their risk profile and investment goals will prefer large companies churning dividends consistently.10-Relative Price Strength: This metric compares last year price performance of stocks within a congruent group. Similar comparison between stock siblings is made for Earnings per share. This type of analysis is typically done by Investor''s Business Daily.11-Return on Equity (ROE): is an important metric, which explains how much money the company is making at the behest of the shareholders'' equity. In simple terms, it elucidates whether the company is efficiently utilizing resources at its disposal and is making profit. This metric is particularly relevant for growth investors. Growth companies should keep track of Return on Equity (ROE) to ensure that the growth projects are generating positive net present value (NPV). The ROE metric clearly speaks of the depth and competency of the management.12-Insider Ownership: It is generally argued that the larger size of the insider ownership is a better indicator of the success of a company. This proposition makes sense because when owners are stakeholders, they would work hard to push the company to success. However this metric standalone cannot indicate the strength of a company. There could be periods when stakeholders would sell stocks to generate money from their changing personal and business needs.13-Forecast on Company''s performance: Value of a company is not based on its past performance. This is because past performance is only relevant to the extent that it can help analysts make some predictions about future trends and growth. However, there is no guarantee that the external environment would stay the same and that the company would repeat its past performance. Equally difficult is the forecast (predictions) about future earnings and revenues of the company. Investors should complete their own due diligence to analyze the possibility of meeting actual earnings and revenue goals.14-Integrity and Depth of Management: This is perhaps the most important metric to make an assessment about the future performance and direction of any company. Performance is a relative term; and will vary depending on the nature of company. For example, from the viewpoint of growth companies, performance is defined by year over year (YOY) growth while maintaining positive return on equity (ROE). For technology companies, performance is underpinned by successful launch of innovation in the guise of new product introductions. The caveat is that innovation is difficult to measure because of its rolling into both tangible and intangible domains. How can you, for example, measure the success or long term value of Apple iphones? The ubiquitous existence of disruptive technologies makes this task even harder. Overall, the depth, maturity and commitment of management is the most important metric to judge the future performance of a company.15-Volatility of Stocks: This metric is absolutely critical in making decisions about the Risk-Return profile of the investor. Put simply, volatility is a measure of how much returns deviate from the average value in a given period of time. Greater volatility implies greater risk. Volatility tends to be higher in the short run and would smooth out to some extent in the long run. Of course, volatility depends on the correlation of stock price to market swings (called as Beta).To conclude, the above framework must be analyzed in a holistic manner. Again these metrics, when combined together, will be viewed differently by the value and growth investors. The value investor would be focused on long term competitive advantage, reputation of brand and relative current valuation of the company. On the other hand, the growth investor will care about past and future growth patterns regardless of 52 week price fluctuations and growth potential (revenue generation) of the company.', 1, '2013-04-03 03:21:08', '2013-04-03 03:21:08', 0),
(767, 'Unique Investment Strategies and Ideas', '<strong>Investing As a Discipline </strong>There is no free lunch in the world of investments. Learn from the history of Stocks and Bonds because: “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it (George Santayana)”. High investment returns cannot be earned without taking substantial risk. Safe investments produce lower returns. As markets are becoming more volatile and unpredictable, the quest for higher returns is coming at the cost of higher risks only.Good companies are generally bad stocks and bad companies are generally good stocks. On a similar note, when the political and economic outlook is positive, returns are relatively lower. Intuitively, when things look gloomy, the returns could potentially be at the highest level. This is because in a period of uncertainty, investors discount future stock income at a higher rate. This would results into lower stock prices with higher expected future returns. Counter-intuitively, when economic environment is optimistic, it is not feasible to invest; because future income is discounted at lower rates (lower perceived risks). This results into higher stock prices and lower expected returns.Recall that according to Gordon equation: Market Return=Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth. The drivers of dividend yield and dividend growth is corporate earnings (both quality and growth of earnings). Over the long term, if the annualized earnings growth rate is about 7%, then the stock price (on annualized basis) should trail this number as well.For bonds, the expected return in the long run is simply its coupon or interest payments. Typically the coupon rate will not change. There is an additional caveat though. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds decline; but the rate at which the interest is reinvested will rise partially offsetting the decline in the value of bonds. In nutshell, the long term bond returns will dovetail the coupon rate.The fundamental return of the Stock Market (Gordon equation) – the sum of long term dividend growth and dividend yield – are somewhat predictable in the long run. However the short term movement driven by volatility and speculation cannot be predicted. There are three “time-bound” drivers of stock prices: dividends in the short term and P/E multiples for short term speculation. For the long term stock value and growth, it is all about dividend growth (indirectly driven by the corporate earnings) from the Gordon equation. In other words, it is possible to predict long term trend of stock market based on Gordon equation to quite an extent; but not possible to make short term predictions due to high degree of volatility and speculations (noise).When the discount rate goes up, the stock prices go down. Higher discount rate implies higher anticipated risk and returns and therefore lower price. In fact, some bad companies can show excellent temporary performance. Tom Peters in his book “In Search of Excellence” demonstrated that the un-excellent companies excelled the excellent companies by a stunning 11% margin per year.Past superior performance has no guarantees for future performance. The capital markets are ruthlessly efficient. Stock picking and timing markets are very costly mistakes. Because there are so many money managers analyzing stocks, their collective wisdom is reflected instantaneously in the stock prices. Thus stock prices behave random and unpredictable. This concept is known as EMH-Efficient Market Hypothesis. Fama was one of its proponents. One example of existence of EMH is that Value Line has not been able to beat the Market Index.Professional Asset Management is a very tough business. Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch are the only two managers who have shown solid evidence of skill. Other managers excelled for a short while and then went into oblivion.Mutual Funds costs are bad news for the investors. There are four key costs of Mutual Funds:(A)-The funds Expense ratio (MER) which is listed in the Prospectus and Annual Statements.(B)-The fund’s Advisory Fees, administrative expenses and commissions paid on transactions. These costs are imbued in such a way that it becomes very difficult to identify how these costs would eat into the returns on these funds.(C)-Bid-Ask Spread: This is the difference between the higher purchase price and lower sale price. The Bid-Ask spread increases with decreasing size of Company.(D)-Finally the impact and rebalancing costs; accrued from external Macroeconomic environment which imbalance the asset allocation strategy and misaligns the composition of Portfolio and its risk matrix.The key driver of a perfect Portfolio is Asset Allocation – built around diversification. The asset allocation is also a function of your risk tolerance and tracking error. Investing in one stock can be quite risky. Your overall asset allocation is determined by your objective, risk tolerance, time horizon and tax situation.Finance is purely behavioral as pointed out by many economists. Greed and Fear will rule investor behavior for all times to come. Most important of all, when investors are pessimist, there is greater expected return in future and vice versa.The major behavior mistakes do not let us achieve our investment goals: limiting beliefs, myopic vision, biases, reliance on patterns, irrational exuberance, herd mentality, the great company illusion, inconsistency and timing the market.It is difficult and counter-productive to clone smart money managers for two reasons: Past good performers sometimes tank; while laggards could potentially perform quite well in future. Second, stellar performance trails funds accumulation from all sources; which ultimately increases exposure to impact costs and misalignment of Portfolio to risk profile. For example, Peter Lynch, the greatest Mutual Funds Manager of all times witnessed diminishing returns of his funds as he scaled up the size of funds and volume of transactions.Start your retirement planning today. Divide your savings into two categories: the long term retirement account invested in a well diversified Portfolio; and a taxable account to meet any financial emergency. This taxable account should normally contain six months of your income to weather any unforeseen liquidity risks. In addition, to this you must also have adequate life and disability insurance.“Survivorship Bias” is a major cause of overstated Performance of Funds. Simply put it is about focusing on short term period when the funds have performed quite well. Some Fund Managers (and Funds) perform well in the short run but if you factor in the long run performance, these funds record below average returns. It is absolutely important to take into account long term performance of the fund and not rely on short term victories, which generally reverse over the long haul.To conclude, using the above principles you can design your own KISS (Keep it simple and sensible) Portfolio with better performance and less costs than most funds. Remember the real value add will come from disciplining your emotions, rebalancing the Portfolio and staying the course.', 1, '2013-01-22 03:20:06', '2013-01-22 03:20:06', 0),
(768, 'Active Portfolio Management With ETFs ', 'The intention of active Portfolio Management is to outperform the Market index. Although it is very difficult to outperform the Market index, yet a majority of fund managers try their luck to excel the market index. Active Portfolio Management involves four key strategies:1 - Technical Chartists: They study the price patterns to interpolate future price movements. The chartists use trend lines as well as volume to analyze the price movement of securities. The premise is that history, as depicted by price patterns, repeats itself. Benjamin Graham stated that this approach may be popular but it is fallacious. This is the reason that no chartist has "consistently or lastingly made money."2 - Momentum Investing: It is a strategy to time the markets. Momentum traders see the rising Price and Earnings trend along with associated Volume increases. Momentum is tracked both for the security and the industry. More important, the longer the time period of trend, the better it is for the investors.3 - Top-Down Strategies: These Strategies focus on key Macroeconomic trends; followed by Industry and geographical dynamics; to bet on the movement of ETFs and Securities. This is rather a very difficult approach as nobody can predict the direction of the market; due to hundreds of complex factors involved in the direction and timing of the Business Cycle.4 - Bottom-Up Approach: Warren Buffet and most fundamentalists believe in bottom-up approach. It is basically fundamental analysis, which focuses on Financial earnings, ratio analysis, M&A and other internal as well as external dynamics facing the company.Passive Investing, as the name indicates, focuses on mimicking an index or benchmark; and does not make any changes to the Portfolio except for the purpose of "rebalancing" due to market changes or redemption (cash withdrawal) of funds.The hardest part of a passive investing strategy is to continue to execute faith and not twist investment strategy, in particular when markets are declining against expectations.ETFs provide an excellent vehicle for low cost diversification; but the risk is correlation between different indices as well as underlying securities. Also it makes little sense to invest in two ETFs which are correlated to each other. The two ETFs are not correlated when their returns-risk profile follow a random pattern. However, in the real world, it is very difficult to find underlying assets which are negatively correlated under all circumstances. In particular during periods of high market volatility, correlation between different asset classes increases - this obviously increases the probability of correlation between different ETFs.', 1, '2013-04-03 03:29:47', '2013-04-03 03:29:47', 0),

(770, 'Key Macroeconomic Trends', '<strong>Key Global Macroeconomic Trends: December 2012 </strong> Sovereign debt crisis has remained a major macroeconomic challenge in 2012. There was a wave of political brinkmanship over Sovereign debt problems in Europe as well as the fiscal cliff in the US. Ironically, the macroeconomic instability could not deter the rebound of global equity markets, which have generated positive returns in 2012. The S&P 500 index recorded a stellar performance of 16%; primarily driven by strong fundamentals taking position in the US economy. It is noteworthy to state that the US housing and job markets have shown significant improvements, thereby improving the consumer confidence. On a similar note in Europe, the German, French and even Greek Markets had shown amazing performance in 2012. It looks like that positive expectations about future outcomes in Europe and the US have weighed heavily on the directions of their respective stock markets.In comparison to the US and European Stock Markets, the Canadian Stock Market has under-performed in 2012. The S&P/TSX composite index registered a mediocre return of 4% mainly because of slumping energy and materials sectors, which had -3.6% and -6.9% YTD returns in Dec 2012. Paradoxically, gold and commodities stocks have performed worst than their underlying commodities. Further there are signs of softening of the Canadian housing market, amidst risks of rising debt to income ratio of Canadian consumers. The 2013 outlook points to some degree of volatility due to fiscal cliff and European Sovereign debt issues. The Chinese manufacturing is in the positive domain and the US fundamentals will trigger further surge of the S&P 500 index. The key question is: what will be the threshold point of Volatility which will not deter the investors from taking positions in the Capital Markets? In either case, the prices of commodities and yields of blue chip stocks and corporate bonds are expected to remain robust through 2013. The key driver of commodities will be the Chinese growth; while the yield on blue chip stocks and high quality corporate bonds will be driven by increasing premium over highly depressed interest rates.<strong>Key Macroeconomic Trends March 2013</strong>1. The roller coaster ride of the US fiscal policy produced more volatility in the capital markets than   the disappointing data coming from Europe and Japan.2. The European Economies (and the housing market) are in recession except for Germany. The European banks are tightening the credit to consumers. This will dampen the consumer spending and lead to decline in the GDP.3. Japan continues to struggle with over two decades of deflation (inflation in the negative zone). Japan plans to pump more money into the economy to trigger some inflation. This strategy will devalue yen indirectly and boost exports.4. Despite fiscal sequestration issues masking the US fiscal scene, the key fundamentals of the US economy are not bad at all. Both the housing and labor markets are rebounding back a bit and it is hoped that these markets will pick further momentum in 2013.5. The Canadian housing market is facing a downturn. The situation is further exacerbated by weakening of economic growth around 1%. The 30% contraction in the housing starts in Q4 2012 does not augur well for the housing health in 2013. Housing is expected to undergo further correction to the extent of 10-15% in 2013-2014. Overall the Canadian economy will most likely encounter 1% range growth in 2013.', 1, '2013-03-14 15:51:54', '2013-03-14 15:51:54', 0);

The US Treasuries, despite some serious Debt implications, are still viewed by the Markets as much safer and risk free instruments. In my opinion, the European debt issue is far from over - there are some countries which have over-leveraged Debt to GDP ratios; Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Italy to name few.What we need to discern is a subtle difference between the US and the European debt issues. These issues may sound similar, but they are quite different both in terms of economic scope and political underpinnings. The US debt, undoubtedly, is a long term challenge as demonstrated by a marked increase in the spread between the yields of Ten year Notes and the corresponding Inflation Protected Treasury securities. The economics is quite simple: more deficit means greater debt; more debt implies higher rates and inflationary pressures; and if they are out of balance this would result in currency crisis, massive devaluations and disturbance of global financial balance.The European debt is a more complicated issue, at least from the standpoint of the geo-economic structure. The US debt issue, notwithstanding the massive size of debt touching $13 trillion plus, is manageable in so far the government apparatus and the Fed are well positioned to attend to any unexpected movement of debt limits. This may not be the case for the European Union - which is facing a dilemma of aligning political and economic interests. For instance, if Greece were to default and its debt restructured, it would relinquish membership of the European Union. Why? Because its currency will have to undergo massive devaluations to re-align the backlog of its horrendous debt and put the house in order again. This is not possible while its strings are attached to the European Central Bank. Ironically this guaranteed cushion by the European Central Bank might promote moral hazard for countries to take on debt and buy time. Such an eventuality might trigger a more serious crisis at a later stage; the solution lies in both short term injection of capital and long term scrutiny to ward-off risks to overleveraged economies.The Fed has deployed unprecedented quantitative easing in history, by utilizing $2.86 trillion Balance Sheet, in order to keep the short term interest rates to near zero level. Remember the Fed has already injected a mammoth dose of $2.3 trillion into the Financial System since the collapse of Lehman Holdings in September 2008. The probability of the Fed continuing this stance of keeping rates on lower end would most likely continue; the key drivers are the slumping Mortgage Insurance and ailing housing markets. Any increase in rates would put unbearable pressure on $914.4 billion of Mortgage-backed debt of the Fed. Concomitantly, the Obama administration is struggling to close massive federal budget deficit of $2 to $4 trillion.In this environment, Treasuries are most likely to rebound in the short term; while yields on Treasury Inflation Protected (TIPS) would escalate in the long term. In my viewpoint, an unstoppable escalation of this "spread" between the two (which would run somewhat parallel to an inverted yield curve) would signal potential threat to the Global economy. Here is the "economics story" behind this key trend witnessed recently:1. Burgeoning Fiscal deficit would prop up the National debt of the US, unless domestic Savings are capable enough to fill the gap - which is not the case.2. Deficits and National debts cannot go beyond certain threshold, without inflicting damage to the economic balance. This is true in case of the US as well although the Fed can print dollars literally from the "thin air" as long as it wants to do so.3. If debt exceeds permissible limits, the first thing to be hit will be the interest rates. Higher rates will cause insurmountable burden on debt servicing as well as dampen consumer demand. Note Consumer spending, impacted directly by the strength of the housing market, is the main driver of GDP growth in the US.4. Higher rates will prove detrimental to a very fragile housing market, which is already facing pressures from an ailing Mortgage Insurance market (a new emerging trend).5. Remember that any quantitative easing by the Fed will keep rates low in the short run; but will come at a cost of burgeoning National debt and consequent expectations about inflations in the future.6. Bonds (Treasuries as well as Debentures) move in an opposite direction to interest rates. Future expectations of lower yields would mean higher price (compensation) for Bonds.7. Finally, interest rates and inflation would move hand in gloves. In this game, expectations are the key determinant of any future play out. Markets are driven by psychological factors - greed and fear - as much as by fundamental factors. In my viewpoint, presently the psychological factors, fear in particular, have masked the "fundamentals" to a great extent. The solution lies in a firm commitment of the Fed and the Government to keep the Fiscal deficits and the National Debts within a plausible limit of the GDP.Last but not least, China is playing a very critical role in maintaining "global financial balance" - it is holding trillions of dollars and Euros of debt; and pumping its exports onto the US and the European Markets. Hefty "consumerism" of Chinese products in the US and Europe is extremely important to keep China churning its exports - any reversal can strain this delicate "financial balance" immensely.', 1, '2013-04-03 03:24:44', '2013-04-03 03:24:44', 0),
(772, 'European Debt Crisis ', 'In this article, I plan to highlight seven key issues faced by Europe currently, which could have a formidable impact on the European and Global Financial Systems in future. The key repercussion of this escalating European and the US debt will be: 1-Weaker capacity of governments to deal with future crisis; 2-Deteriorating impact on currencies and paper money; 3-High Inflation expectations which will drive demand of gold; 4-Pressure on governments of developed countries to attend to the needs of a growing population of the baby boomers; and 5-Incapacity of Central Banks to keep the interest rates lower.Issue One: The documentation of Current Accounts (and the Economy) and its effective auditing never prevailed in some of the European countries, notably in Greece. The clear manifestation of this loophole can be found in the ongoing Greek crisis. Nobody could predict that the problem could assume such horrendous dimensions. Who has the right accounting record to fathom the magnitude of problem even today?Issue Two: The European Central Bank (ECB) did not design a robust fire-fighting mechanism to cope with the highly indebted European countries. The member states built massive debts on their balance sheets. This is also part of the Moral Hazard issue which means not to act so responsibly in the hope of getting bailed out ultimately.Issue Three: Mass Psychology and Program Trading can exacerbate the situation in an uncertain environment. The Greek debt crisis had a snowball effect on debt securities of Spain and Italy. The credit spread for their bonds has increased in the past six months. As a result, these heavily indebted countries have fallen into a vicious trap on account of increased debt and ensuing risks to the economy. Logically, increased riskiness leads to hike in interest rates, which dampens the economy and stock markets. For ECB, this implies worsening of already deteriorated balance sheet.Issue Four: Politics cannot be divorced from Economic Policy. The current austerity measures tailored by the Greek government would always face resistance from its people. Social and political divergence in Europe, rooted in rich historical traditions, would always lead to weaker implementation of the Structural Adjustment Plans - a recipe practiced by the IMF in emerging economies for many decades.Issue Five: Germany, with a stable and a strong economy, remains as a leader and role model in Europe. Yet it does not have a well-designed mechanism or political influence to facilitate reforms in other members of the ECB - of course using ECB as a bastion of reforms. Divergent European economies are more sensitive to imposition of external solutions, let alone emulating the economic accomplishments of Germany in the post-unification era.Issue Six: Economists never analyze Debt in isolation, neither for companies nor for countries. For economies, it is benchmarked to real GDP growth. Stringent fiscal measures can muster some discipline in the short run; yet in the long run this would dampen the recession further. Using the analogy of a household it might be a good idea to curtail expenditure; better still would be to generate greater income and budget it for rainy days!Issue Seven: Most important of all, the European debt solution is a long term struggle given both the complexity of issues; and typical fiscal policy time-lags. Imposition of austerity measures unilaterally can sink Europe (already in recession) into deflation, witnessed by Japan in the 1990s. Deflation, defined as persistent decrease in price level, is detrimental to the growth of economy and the stock markets. The solution to avoid Deflation rests on a three pronged strategy: 1-Building fiscal discipline in highly indebted European countries; 2-Designing a painless exit strategy of defaulting economies in order to avoid complete crumbling of the European Monetary Union; and 3-Creating a powerful external mechanism that would stimulate the moribund European economies.', 1, '2013-04-03 03:32:11', '2013-04-03 03:32:11', 0),

(775, 'Macroeconomic Theories', 'Economists have generally put forth following key economic theories which elucidate fluctuations in the relative valuations of currencies. These major theories are briefly explained below:1-The international Fisher effect: According to this theory, the value of currencies between two countries A and B would be driven by the difference between the nominal interest rates. For example, the currency of the lower nominal rate currency should appreciate against the higher nominal rate currency by the same amount.2-The Asset Market Model: This model focuses on how much money is flowing into any country to purchase stocks, bonds and other securities. The greater the flow of capital, the more will be the appreciation of the recipient currency.3-The Monetary Model: The Central Bank and the Treasury play an important role in controlling inflation; and concomitantly triggering expectations about future inflationary trends. Lower rates and easy monetary policy (operating typically at full employment level) would raise inflationary expectations about future. If credit is available easily, it will automatically lead to credit boom and consequently increase in the price level.4-The real rate difference between two countries: when real rates are higher, currencies in those countries will appreciate. Conversely, countries with lower rates will decline in value. This is because foreign and domestic investors will invest in countries with higher real interest rates.5-The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is another interesting theory which states that the cost (price) of all commodities should be equalized across all countries. Currency of country with lower inflation should appreciate against the higher inflation country.6-The balance of payments theory postulates that a country running larger current account balance will face a downward pressure on its currency. During the Asian flu of 1997, the currencies of Asian economies underwent massive depreciation after the number of non-performing loans of local banks (denominated in the US dollar) escalated. Remember Current Account is only one factor in the stability of currency. Other factors also count towards the strength of the local currency. For example, the US has been running deficits for a long period of time, yet the US dollar gains "periodic strength" during economic crisis. This is because US dollar is considered as a safe haven currency.To conclude, these economic theories work only under specific assumptions (conditions) in a perfect world with little or no transaction costs and perfect mobility of capital. In the real world, there are uncountable factors which determine the exchange rate at certain point of time. These theories might work; assuming low transaction costs and other hiccups in the long run. In the short run, macroeconomic indicators are a better barometer for currency valuation.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269840', 1, '2014-03-24 23:47:07', '2014-03-24 23:47:07', 0),
(777, 'Sovereign Debt Crisis', 'This brief article examines the fundamental question: what are the causes of burgeoning Sovereign debt of advanced economies? And what are the implications of this development for the global economy?Causes of escalating debt of Advanced EconomiesThe G-7 public debt as a percentage of GDP has increased consistently since 1977. It is important to note that the gross public debt or net public debt is not meaningful without being analyzed in the context of the Gross domestic product (GDP). The logic behind this metric is simple: if a country could double its GDP, the net effect of doubling its debt will be zero. This concept works similar to that of leverage in the equities market, which is considered as a double-edged sword. If the value of equity increases, profits are magnified using leverage. Conversely, if the value of equity declines, losses are amplified too. On a similar note, if a country can produce GDP at a rate faster that the rate of its debt accumulation, the country can build substantial capacity to absorb additional debt without thwarting its growth prospects.The main causes of debt escalation in the advanced economies are as follows:(A)-Fiscal stimulus packages in the aftermath of economic crisis of 2008. In particular, the US stimulus packages have been of unprecedented magnitude, which have increased the US national debt manifold.(B)-Nationalization of private debts of giant private banks, from Merrill Lynch to Citigroup.(C)-Incapacity of government to levy taxes and raise revenues. Overall, the above three factors have led to increased debt burdens acquired by the advanced economies.(D)-Aging population will put additional strain on the fiscal health of the advanced economies.Comparative analysis of Debt sustainability: Advanced vs. Emerging EconomiesAnalyzing the data of the IMF World Economic Outlook (Sep 2011), gross general Government debt as percent of GDP increased from 72.7% in 2000 to 79.9% in 2008 (the forecasts for 2016 are 108.2%). For G-7 advanced economies, gross general government debt as percent of GDP increased from 77.5% in 2000 to 90.3% in 2009 (the forecasts are 127.4%). The same numbers for the emerging and developing economies are 48.5% in 2000 to 32.5% in 2008 (with forecast of decline to 29.2% in 2016). This shows clearly that the debt levels have declined consistently in the emerging and developing countries.The Economics of Sovereign Debt Accumulation and InflationInflation is generally considered good for debtors, who would find it convenient to pay loans with cheaper dollars in future. But the bad news is that as money is pumped into the economy, inflation does not rise immediately and uniformly. Prices spread gradually across different sectors. Worst of all, it looks that these sectors are booming. But the temporary booms are adjusted with output contraction and the final result is escalation of price level. The current strategy of money supply as practiced in the US and Euro-zone to an extent, aiming to keep the interest rates low, will inflate these economies in near future. Fractional reserve banking will simply magnify this impact. Rising prices lead to massive depreciation of currencies, thereby creating misallocation of resources and economic inefficiencies. Governments have a tendency to acquire high levels of debt, unlike the private sector due to the following key factors:(A)-Government can impose taxes on public to raise revenue and pay off interest on debts. The private sector does not generally have such capacity to raise revenue painlessly.(B)-In case of Public debt, there is no precise metric (For example, debt at 60% of GDP) which could signal precisely what is going to happen in future (or raise red flags). Public debt has many caveats attached to it. It is rather difficult to simplify "public debt as percent of GDP". In contrast, it is pretty simple to use "debt to income" ratio for private individuals and companies. The Public debt analysis is arbitrary to an extent as explained above; while the Private debt is built around tight accounting principles.(C)-There is no international bankruptcy court or adjudication body to enforce legal contracts of national debt. It is in the interest of the governments not to default, as it can have serious political backlash. Also potential default would lead to downgrading of bonds by credit rating agencies, which would imply more expensive debt in future.(D)-There is some degree of Moral Hazard issues attached to Public debt, both in the advanced as well as emerging economies. What is Moral Hazard? It is a tendency by a party to take risks because the costs of any failure will not be borne by that party. For advanced economies, as happened during the economic crisis of 2008, the private banks and organizations indulge in irresponsible financial practices in the hope that they will be bailed out by the Government and Central Banks in the US, China and Europe.For emerging economies, Moral Hazard problem assumes different dimension. It is the government per se which resorts to Moral Hazard along with the private sector institutions. They take on massive debts without efficient utilization of money thereby inflating the economy (commonly called as Dutch disease). They foster hopes that the International development institutions like Asian Development Bank, IMF and World Bank will come to the rescue in case of potential default using tools like "Structural Adjustment Programs."Implications of Over-indebtedness of Advanced economiesFor the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) countries, the current debt situation is not sustainable. The recipe of austerity measures, apart from creating political backlash; acts as a countervailing force to monetary policy stimulus. This is because "austerity" entails cutting down on development expenditure and possibly increasing taxes. Given below full employment level of economy, as is the case for the Euro-zone currently, the current austerity measures will lead to further contraction of the economy. The paradox of "Euro-zone Austerity" measures is that these will choke growth and push the economy on a long term recessionary spiral path.In contrast, the US economy is much more "resilient" than the Euro-zone because of the following three key reasons: (A)-the US dollar remains as the international reserve currency; which not only makes US dollar as safe haven currency but also gives ability to the US government to borrow at lower interest rate; (B)-the fundamentals of the US economy are stronger than the Euro-zone individual economies; (C)-the innovation and productivity of the US economy is a very strong intangible, which will continue to add strength to the US dollar in the foreseeable future. However, the US growth might slow down in the short run because of the falling external demand (Europe in particular) for exports.Finally, if we make an analytical comparison between advanced and emerging economies, the probability of growth (accompanied with less debt burden) is much higher in the emerging economies than the advanced ones. The logical implication is that the emerging economies will most probably finance the deficits and growth of the advanced economies in the next decade.To conclude, the next economic crisis of Sovereign debt has already started. Perhaps it will not unleash into a severe economic downturn as it happened in 2008-2009, yet it will be strong enough to choke the long term growth prospects of advanced economies. It may lead onto deflation (freezing of prices) in the short run; similar to situation confronted by Japan for over two decades. And in the long run, it may morph onto a period of hyperinflation, in particular if the prices of oil ramp up. This phenomenon of over-indebtedness also increases the probability of a long secular bear market in stocks and bonds; with savvy investors gravitating towards gold and precious metals. This is logical realignment of investment direction given the fact that gold and precious metals provide reasonable hedge against inflation.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269819', 1, '2014-03-24 23:48:31', '2014-03-24 23:48:31', 0),
(778, 'Technology and Economics - The Emerging Trends in 2013', 'Technology and Economics move in tandem. Technological advancement increases efficiency and productive capacity of the economy; which leads to long term economic growth and prosperity. Today''s competitive landscape of different technologies is under-pinned with intense rivalry, temporary disruption of existing technologies; followed by commoditization due to low cost barriers. Here are five recent examples of emerging technology trends:1-Stock Markets of World have become extremely volatile because information is executed instantaneously without giving any reaction time for market players to perceive the depth of fundamentals. It takes much longer to analyze the fundamentals of stocks than absorption of instantaneous messages bombarded in fractions of seconds. Such plethora of messages, coupled with Media hype, has created marked volatility in the Capital Markets of the world.2-Although Facebook and LinkedIn are not competitors in true sense, LinkedIn has done much better job in terms of cash generation; and consequently surge in its stock as compared to Facebook. The main driver behind cash generation is strategic positioning of LinkedIn in the talent acquisition industry, mainly in North America. This has enabled the company to double its stock in one year; whereas Facebook is still struggling to recover its stock lurking much below than its IPO point.3-There is an exponential growth of mammoth data, which determines the competitive landscape and future growth path of companies. Conventionally data was restricted to sales and inventory; which did not present holistic picture of a company''s performance. Now the trend is to embrace Big Data, entailing Social Media and Business Intelligence. There is a massive on-going demand for housing and securing this data using Cloud compatible solutions.4-Crowd-funding is another emerging trend backed by online technologies. If successful, it will disrupt the conventional venture capitalist model. From the perspective of technology, this model faces few challenges. However, from the regulations standpoint, there are formidable challenges, in particular for the conservative regulatory regimes like Canada.5-The trend is also to "connect everything to internet" using mobile technologies. This ultra-integration would require extremely data intensive processes combined with telecommunications - all rolled onto the emerging world of cloud computing. However, this "technology utopia" of ultra-integration is replete with three key challenges: First, security of data in the world of cloud computing is a colossal challenge, although some companies like Blackberry claim to possess viable solutions. Second, telecommunication costs place constraint on what could be an optimal solution in terms of benefits versus costs. Third, it is rather difficult to work out a lean and sustainable model that avoids unnecessary information overload.To conclude, technology is playing an increasingly uncertain but very important role in shaping the contemporary world; and this has massive economic implications at both macro and micro levels. One key implication is that most disruptive technologies are invaded by glut of new entrants until that technology is commoditized to a great extent. This adds complexity to the fast changing landscape of new emerging technologies and how efficiently these could fulfill consumer demands.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7553756', 1, '2014-03-24 23:48:56', '2014-03-24 23:48:56', 0),

(781, 'The Principles of Austrian Economics', 'The objective of this article is to summarize the principles of economics related to the Austrian school of economics. The Austrian school originated at the University of Vienna by Carl Menger. Today, the Austrian school represents a different perspective from the mainstream economics. The key principles of Austrian school are summarized below:1-Menger was of view that Economics and physical sciences were quite different in so far that the former involved human emotions, which are quite difficult to measure, whereas the latter involved dimensions which can be readily measured.2-The Austrian and Mainstream economics have common views on Margin Utility. People tend to acquire first what gives them the maximum satisfaction; and give up first what gives them the least satisfaction. The measurement of Margin Utility is highly subjective and cannot be quantified easily. It varies from one individual to another.3-Friedrich Hyek and Ludwig Von Mises argued that the booms and busts originate due to injection of money by the policy makers. Driven by greed, the investors make investment decisions. When money is withdrawn and investors realize about wrong investment decisions, consumers pull back and the artificial boom collapses. The state and society may not be right in making decisions. It is the individual who would make choices and decisions. Therefore it is absolutely essential to understand how individuals make their choices (decisions). Economics is highly subjective and is different from other sciences in so far we cannot make direct measurements in economics. All economic decisions are intrinsically subjective and depend on the perception and values of individuals.4-Markets are in a continuous state of flux. The market actors strive for competition to identify gaps, fill these needs and make profits. Competition is a continuous process of discovery.5-Production cannot be re-used in most cases and changes in demand can affect the production process substantially. Production is inherently quite risky.6-Inflation is dangerous for economic stability. Money is like a commodity. If the government circulates more money in the economy, its value dips with the net result of overall increase in the price level. The government and Central Banks by pumping too much money would bring temporary booms only. When things get settled down, the economy recoils back to the real equilibrium but with greater level of inflation.7-Government intervention is not justified, even if it is well-intentioned. Government cannot ascertain precise information at certain point of time. First because individuals keep changing their plans and second it becomes quite different to read the mind and behavior of individuals. The government often makes wrong judgments and distorts equilibrium, which cannot be visible to the policy makers due to complexity of ever changing human perception of values.8-Society as a whole does not have its own collective mind or purpose. It is the individuals who have their own independent minds and not society per se. Economic events emanate from these individual decisions. It is because of the emphasis of the Austrian economics on individual decisions that they do not give much importance to macroeconomics.9-Low interest rates, unfortunately, fuel credit-booms that would motivate investors to invest in wrong places. When the bubble bursts, the waste in the investment process becomes obvious. Moreover with lower interest rates people tend to borrow more from banks, sometimes beyond their capacity. The fractional reserve banking system reinforces this phenomenon. When the artificial trends are reversed, the economy contracts and moves into recession.10-According to Austrian economists, inflation is not defined in terms of rising price level but in terms of increasing money supply. They use the term of "inflationary expansion" generally triggered by the government policies. Most important, the Austrian economists believe that the rise of price index is not accurate barometer of inflation in the economy. Price index is determined by the choice of underlying basket of goods. This choice is arbitrary and will produce different results. One solution could be to peg dollar to a commodity like gold. Unfortunately this is not a practical solution because of "limited amount" of gold in the world. Hayek had suggested the idea of competition among currencies. It is easier said than done. Governments and central banks by the end of day will exercise tight controls to defeat the ideas of competing currencies.To conclude, the Austrian school is more focused on individual behavior and choices. It does not support macroeconomic interventions by the governments, at least in the Keynesian sense of monetary policy management, to keep interest rates low for a long period of time (as happened in the US since 2006). This artificial dampening of rates would eventually fuel temporary credit booms likely to be busted at some stage. The end result is nothing but downturn in the economy, this time perhaps accompanied with soaring prices.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269824', 1, '2014-03-24 23:51:36', '2014-03-24 23:51:36', 0),
(782, 'The Virtue of Staying Invested', 'The objective of this article is to make readers realize that long term investors will benefit from the volatile markets of today.In an era of rapid information movement, markets have developed significant "mood swings". These swings are not driven by "market fundamentals" alone; "news hype" would significantly impact market movements and valuations as well. In other words, there are three key players which affect the modern capital markets: first speculators who attempt to ride the wave of markets in the hope of making short term gains; second conventional financial media which 1es hyped news to attract masses; and third burgeoning social media channels generating democratization of ideas. These three forces in combination with advanced emerging technologies have generated ubiquitous information causing improved efficiency in the global capital markets. This means market fundamentals lag behind these information waves; thereby producing volatility in the global capital markets.The positive news is that regardless of the market environment, investors always find some opportunities for growth. More important, investors profit from this volatility by exercising patience and staying invested in the long term.Investors can weather volatility by adopting following key smoothing strategies:1-Focus on long term strategies while ignoring short term volatility.2-Perform dollar-cost averaging which means buying stocks at different points of time regularly. You buy cheap stocks when markets are down. This is obviously an efficient strategy to average out the cost of purchasing stocks.3-Re-align your portfolio to your specific risk profile. Invest in stocks if you have a higher risk profile, and invest in the fixed income securities if you have lower tolerance for risk.4-Rebalance your portfolio: you need to keep your portfolio (combination of equities and fixed income) balanced; aligning to changing market conditions.5-When everybody is buying stocks and the economy has reached its peak, perhaps it is time to switch to more conservative investing. When market has declined substantially, it might be a good idea to purchase equities and offload bonds and fixed income securities.Following are some examples of outstanding investment opportunities emerging during financial-economic crisis:1-In the period 1929-1932, about 11,000 banks collapsed while the value of stocks declined by over 70%. In the post depression era, some giants like Toyota and Walt Disney emerged.2-The 1970s was a period of high inflation in North America and Europe. This situation was exacerbated by hike in oil prices-both by the 1973 oil embargo crisis as well as the geopolitical turmoil wrought by the Iranian revolution of 1979. During this period, some of the opportunities which emerged were software giant Microsoft and the cell-phones. These technologies have revolutionized the world.3-In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a series of economic recessions which led to failure of more than 1600 banking institutions in the US. Notwithstanding this mass-scale failure of Banks, the financial stability was maintained due to promise of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits. Consequently there was no panic or bank run as was witnessed during the Great Depression. The invention of Internet in the 1990s and the compact discs in the 1980s were some outstanding developments of the period.4-The economic crisis of 2007-2008 has shifted the focus of investment opportunities toward the emerging economies. The potential high growth of big five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) as well as Frontier economies will continue to attract investors for investment in these economies. The rapid flow of information, growth of mobile internet and 3G technologies and emergence of social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) will go a long way in the globalization of investment portfolios.To conclude, global capital markets have become quite efficient due to growth of fast information underpinned by the emerging technologies. This has produced greater volatility though. Successful investors will pick the right investments and stay invested steadfast for reasonable length of time (for example five to seven years). The principle of modern day efficient markets is: rolling stone gathers no moss.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7269832', 1, '2014-03-24 23:52:42', '2014-03-24 23:52:42', 0),
(783, 'Three Ways To Measure GDP', 'Gross Domestic Product GDP is the aggregate of goods and services produced in a country. There are three ways to compute GDP:1-The Output Approach: This is calculated by summing up Value Added activities across the production economy, while eliminating instances of double counting. The challenge with this approach is to get right accounting data, which would focus on Value Added activities.2-The Expenditure Approach: The expenditure approach is measured by adding consumption, investment, exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services. Consumption is both private and government sponsored. In the developed economies, consumption constitutes 50-70% component of GDP. Investment is undertaken by private investors. The "total final expenditure" equals the sum of Consumption expenditure, investments and exports of goods and services.3-The Income Approach: The income approach of GDP measurement is based on premise that we total the income of all factors of production. Specifically, these incomes include wages or salaries of employees, self-employment income, profits of companies, rental income and profit of government corporations.These three approaches never reach the same number. The key reasons for their discrepancy are attributable to black economy, limitations of data, voluntary services and some transactions which cannot be translated in monetary terms. Notwithstanding these discrepancies, another noise that accentuates the GDP variations in different countries is the difference in price levels or inflation rates existing at different places. Purchasing Power Parity method could be one way to smooth out these fluctuations albeit some caveats about how data is obtained. In addition, most economists predict degree of convergence of GDP growth rates between the developing and the developed countries in the next decade. The emerging economies of the world, in particular BRIC nations are catching up fast to reach GDP levels of OECD countries in near future. However, what economists do not take into account is the fact that it is not GDP growth rate per se what matters most, but the quality and per capita trends of GDP growth as well.More important, GDP might not explain some key intangibles like technological advancement, rule of law and quality of living and education existing in some developed countries. For example, the US Economy has huge intangibles in terms of Technological advancement which would make it a global leader for a long time to come. To conclude, GDP growth standalone is not a strong measure of economic prosperity and has to be analyzed in tandem with other qualitative measures of economic affluence.Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/7481657', 1, '2014-03-24 23:53:10', '2014-03-24 23:53:10', 0);

It cannot be ruled out this hyperinflation may be preceded by an era of a higher deflation and sluggish economic growth.(VI)-Gold, notwithstanding its recent volatility, will continue to provide a decent hedge against inflation and depreciating currencies.

On the other hand, the emerging economies with less debt burden are moving faster on the economic growth path.The critical question remains: who would finance/fund the escalating debt burden of the advanced economies? With declining growth rates, the developed countries cannot finance savings internally. This scenario is strengthened further by the risks of deflation due to “deleveraging” of economy as well as sagging consumer demand. Who else could fund the ever growing debts of the developed nations? The most probable candidate, of course, is the group of emerging economies, which will be growing 6-7% on average in the next decade.However, what is the guarantee of this global funding of debt by the emerging economies? It is rather difficult to answer this question at this stage. All will depend on the perception about vitality of major global currencies including Yen and the US dollar. It is noteworthy that the emerging economies, China and India in particular, are building internal resilience to absorb their savings surpluses and therefore finance their debts without dependence on the foreign sector.

(1364, 'Business Cycles and Contrarian Investing ', ' Fluctuations in output and unemployment are called as Business Cycles. There are five distinct phases of Business Cycle as explained below. The important point to underscore is that the stock market is a leading indicator of the performance of the economy; yet it is extremely difficult to anticipate correctly the timing of business cycles in the real world.Trough: Ensuing recession, due to dampened demand and excess capacity, keeps inflation under control. Interest rates are very low. Falling prices and lower interest rates stimulate demand to some extent. As well as stocks begin to rally. From the standpoint of Contrarians, this would be a good time to start making investments in the stock market.Recovery: Interest rates are low and prices may fall a bit; due to excess capacity already existing. Firms and households begin purchase of consumer items; and some activity is seen in the stock market.Expansion: As demand grows, businesses adjust their inventories; and begin to make new capital investments. Real GDP grows and there is anticipation of inflation & high interest rates.Peak: The demand outstrips capacity; interest rates increase; and inflation rises. This results in halt on business activity and stock prices begin to slow down. It is because of this reason that the Contrarians will always advise to short stocks before the economy reaches the peak.Contraction: As the economy cools down, the supply exceeds demand and inventories begin to pile up. Customers cut down on expenditure and focus on savings. Central Banks step forward to cut interest rates. Unemployment worsens.

(1365, 'Deflation, Soft Landing and Real Interest Rates, ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: It is ironical to note that the real interest rates can stay very high in a deflationary environment despite attempts by central bank to cut rates to 0%. How is this possible? Here is a possible explanation. Look at the following equation: Real Rate = Nominal Rate – Inflation Rate.In the above equation, suppose nominal rates become zero. The central bank cannot cut rates below zero. Deflation (negative inflation) will lead to higher real rates. The corporate sector will not take loans in a deflationary environment and too much of money (and savings) supply will keep the nominal rates capped to zero.Soft Landing is considered as a Holy Grail of Policy-makers. It entails a growth rate good enough to avert economy from landing into recession rate; and an inflation rate appropriate enough to avert high expectations about inflation. In other words, this is position focuses on a balance point on the sacrifice ratio – higher growth comes at the expense of inflation.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1366, 'What determines the level of Interest rates? ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: Higher interest rates and rising level of inflation are generally viewed as bad both for the stocks and the bonds market; and good for the commodities market. Yet there would be some exceptions due to complex Inter-market relations. More importantly, expectations play a very prominent role in the determination of interest as well as inflation rates.Following are key determinants of interest rates:1.	Expectations: Interest rates are built around future expectations. If people have credibility in the functioning of the central bank, they will take actions which keep the interest rates steady.2.	Inflation: Inflation is good for borrowers and bad for lenders. When lenders expect inflation, they will charge higher interest rates.3.	Foreign interest rates: These rates have influence on the domestic rates. For example, if the Canadian dollar is under persistent pressure due to lower rates, in comparison to USD, the Bank of Canada may act to strengthen the Canadian Currency by raising the Bank rate.4.	The central bank can regulate short and long term rates. Pumping money into the economy will trim rates, while tightening the supply will prop up rates. In any case, the bank will not be able to influence the long term rates.5.	Interest rates and risk valuation go hand in gloves. There is always a risk premium on all kinds of rates prevailing in the economy. Lenders will demand greater return in risky situations. An investor will ask for a greater risk premium over a risk free rate when investing, for example, in high risk debentures.6.	The supply and demand of loanable funds play a great role in interest rate determination. For example, government deficit may lead to higher borrowing and consequently an upward pressure on rates. In contrast, easing of money will lower the rates. Similarly, an increase in the savings of government, companies or households may reduce demand and interest rates.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1367, 'Economic Output and Inflation Dynamics, ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar:Money Supply and InflationThere is some evidence of inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation – called as sacrifice ratio. For example, a sacrifice ratio of 5 would mean that you need to sacrifice 5% of GDP to cut inflation rate by 1%.Higher Money growth may increase output in the short run, by lowering interest rates and triggering investments. But this may not happen under all circumstances. For example during the great deleveraging of Japanese economy in the 1990s, firms did not borrow money despite the fact that interest rates were practically zero.In the long run, money is neutral and changes in the money supply translate fully into price increase; and the real variables of the economy remain unchanged.Wage Inflation and economic output gapCan the economy employ all citizens/residents actively seeking work? The answer is no. At some stage in the economy, there is always going to be frictional and structural unemployment. This implies that every economy has a natural unemployment rate called as the Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). The gap between the actual unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate has important implications for the wage inflation.•	When the actual unemployment level is above the NAIRU, there is an excess supply of labor force in the market and it keeps a tab on wage inflation.•	Conversely when the actual unemployment level is below the NAIRU, there is a pressure on companies to seek workers. This gives bargaining power to the labor force and ultimately fuels wage inflation.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Spin-off subsidiary, released from the parent control, emerges as a standalone corporation with greater flexibility and access to capital markets. In a Spin-off deal, the parent would record gains (losses) equivalent to sales minus the net asset value of the subsidiary. Spin-offs or divestitures are viewed favorably by the market: as it leads to downsizing, better allocation of capital resources & convergence on core competencies. It unleashes the entrepreneurial potential in the Standalone Corporation and therefore offers a unique attractive perspective to investors.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1382, 'Stop Loss Order vs. Stop Buy Order ', ' Stop Loss Orders aim to protect the free fall of a declining security – thus limiting the loss or protecting the profit. On a rising trend, it is better to have a trailing stop loss order. More importantly, stop loss orders should be at a certain distance from the market price level in order to avoid execution by a choppy market. In contrast, Stop Buy Orders are applicable in the context of shorting stocks. You instruct your broker to buy a stock after it reaches certain price level. Again if the stock is moving down, it is appropriate to have trailing stop buy orders.The following example will clarify the above point:I purchase a stock at $10 and in a month’s time it rises to $15. I want to lock my profit now. I will ask my broker to place a stop loss order at $13 (some distance below the current price). Suppose the stock next moves to $20. I will ask my broker to shift the stop loss order to $17. In other words, I have put a trailing stop loss order at some distance (typically this distance can be 10-15% of the change in price level).Suppose I shorted a stock at $20 and hope that it will decrease in price. The stock slides to $15. I am nervous that the stock may not rise back to $20 or go beyond it. I would ask my broker to put a stop buy order at $17 just above $15. If the stock declines further to $13, I will trail the stop buy order to $15. Just to refresh the memory of readers, stop buy order is applicable when we short stocks. Shorting is a process whereby you would borrow stocks from your broker and sell them in market with the hope to buy back those stocks at a lower price level. The risk is an unexpected increase in the price of stock. Regardless of the price of shorted stocks, the investor is bound to return the borrowed stocks to the broker. If the stock price declines, the short will gain profit; conversely if the price goes up, the short will lose money.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1386, 'Which is a better measure of Stock Performance – Earnings vs. Cash Flows? ', 'There has been a debate whether Earnings or Cash flows represent a better assessment of a stock’s value? While the Cash Flow measures inflows and outflows within a specific time period; Earnings would measure net flows accrued from an operating cycle. The advantage of using Earnings as a Valuation measure is a better understanding of “repetitive operations” of the Company; and this will lead to a better handle on projecting the forecasted earnings of the company. On the other hand, Cash Flows are merely receipts and payments and it becomes hard to make future predictions about the value of stock based on this piece of information alone.The disadvantage of using Earnings as a yardstick of performance is on account of “discretionary accounting decisions” exercised by the management. For example, the management can take decisions to speed up revenue recognition or slow down expense recognition. Also there is a great degree of flexibility in recognition (amortization) of non-recurring events. These accounting gimmicks, if not checked internally & audited externally, can become a problem and in some cases not allow correct assessment of current and future earning capacity of a company. In contrast, Cash Flows estimation is a credible measure of a Company’s current performance. This is the core “Stock Valuation Conundrum” – Cash Flow valuation is credible but not relevant; Earnings valuation is relevant but not credible! It is therefore recommended to analyze Earnings in tandem with Cash Flows and point out any discrepancies between them. Any serious mismatch between the two should be viewed as a potential red-flag!DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1387, 'The Value Maximizing level of Debt (Optimal leverage) ', ' Leverage (a possible proxy for corporate risk) can be defined as the ratio of liabilities to assets; or the ratio of debt to total capital (debt plus equity). Leverage is a double-edged sword, because it can magnify both returns and losses. Companies typically aim to achieve rate of return on projects that would exceed the cost of borrowing – thereby generating Value creation. More importantly, all this will happen from relatively cheaper before-tax dollars (interest payments on debt are tax deductible). The perception of Market stays positive in raising debt as long as the Debt to Equity ratio looks reasonable. In contrast, raising equity is more costly as dividends in most countries are not tax deductible. Modigliani and Merton in their MM Theory pointed out: “a world with no taxes, perfect and credible disclosure of all information, and no transactions costs associated with raising money or going bankrupt – the extent of debt in a company’s capital structure does not affect the firm value.” However there is no free lunch and this theory will not hold in the practical world. This is because there are diminishing marginal returns to increasing leverage (until we reach the optimal level of debt). What leads to such diminished marginal returns on debt?•	As debt burden increases, the marginal increase of shielded income decreases.•	Potential risks of bankruptcy raise red flags. Bankruptcy can have serious transaction costs, lawyer fees and drag on intangibles of the company.•	Highly indebted companies are more vulnerable to economic swings.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

In the real world, this is not the case because market risk can span across a spectrum of risks like Interest rate risk, inflation risk, exchange rate risk and so on. For example, there could be 4-7 betas, each defined by a specific market risk. These betas are driven by pertinent Macroeconomic factors. The overall risk will be the summation of these specific risks. The Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) attempts to capture these detailed factors in order to better explain/qualify the CAPM Model.One shortcoming of APT is that it does not pin down specific Macroeconomic factors. An analyst still needs to deploy relevant factors and customize the APT model. Remember that the fundamental value of a company is based on discounted cash flows in the form of expected dividends. Therefore we need to identify pertinent macroeconomic factors that can affect expected future dividends of a company.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1389, 'Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Stock Valuation, ', 'What is the discount rate for a risky project? For risk free projects, it is the risk free rate of interest – normally those offered by the Treasury bills. You need to add premium to the risk-free rate to discount risky projects and investments. For example, stock investments are more risky than Treasury bills and would require a greater return on investments. This difference between the required return on stocks and risk-free rate is called as “Equity Risk Premium”.CAPM theory states in simple words that while a diversified portfolio can eliminate company-specific risks, it cannot eliminate equity market risk. The latter measure of risk is approximated by Beta – which is sensitivity of stock price to the overall changes in the stock market (and of course the macro-economy). For example, a stock with beta of 1.0 would move in line with the equity market; one with beta greater than 1.0 is more sensitive to market movements; and one with beta less than 1.0 is relatively less sensitive. Treasury bills should have a zero beta value.In nutshell, CAPM suggests that the required return on a stock is equal to the risk free rate plus beta multiplied by the prevailing equity risk premium. Higher the risk (beta), higher would be the required return expected by the investors. DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Among these are costs of carrying, ordering, storing, as well as risks of obsolescence, spoilage, shrinkage, undetected defects and inadequate insurance etc. Inventory Costs can involve enormous amount of money.The JIT seeks to provide the exact amount of production materials when needed, without shortages or excess inventory.JIT minimizes Production Variances in the following ways:•	Small lot sizes are used•	The stages of manufacturing cycle are fully synchronized•	Inventory use is driven by demand forecasts – the pull approach•	Optimum utilization of resources.The Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) is the most important area of focus to achieve cost efficiencies and to strengthen the operating margins. COPQ can take one or all of the following forms: Post shipment defects, scrap, decay, spoilage, rework, downtime, debugging, software errors, cost of field servicing, costs of handling complaints, warranty repairs and replacements.Both Operations and R&D organizations are jointly responsible for COPQ. These two functions must make joint efforts to control COPQ as it becomes hard to identify actual source of COPQ. Companies deploy lean six sigma projects across “internal supply chain” to cut COPQ and generate substantial cost savings. Poor quality adds to the routine costs of production. “Operational effectiveness” plays a critical role in enhancing productivity (efficiency) and strengthening operating margins. In a cross-functional setting, business operations and processes need to be effective in different functional areas all across the value chain. Business divisions must design and structure “critical business processes” efficiently to achieve operational effectiveness. More importantly, these “business processes” should focus on timely value creation activities which must be thoroughly documented in specific “Standing Operating Procedures” SOPs.

(1397, 'Financial Leverage ', 'Please listen to the following You Tube Webinar: Financial leverage (FL) takes the form of a loan or other borrowings (debt), the proceeds of which are reinvested with the intent to earn a rate of return greater than the cost of interest. If the firm''s rate of return on assets (ROA) [also called as return on investment (ROI)] is higher than the rate of interest on the loan, then its return on equity (ROE) will be higher than if it did not borrow. On the other hand, if the firm''s ROA is lower than the interest rate, then its ROE will be lower than if it did not borrow. Leverage allows greater potential returns to the investor than otherwise would have been available. The potential for loss is also greater, because if the investment becomes worthless, the loan principal and all accrued interest on the loan still need to be repaid.A firm''s debt to equity ratio (measured at market value or book value, depending on the purpose of the analysis) is therefore an indication of its leverage. Degree of financial leverage (DFL) may be defined as the percentage change in earnings (Earnings per share) that occurs as a result of a percentage change in earnings before interest and taxes.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Revenue growth that emanates from solid and credible brands in a growth market will have positive consistent impact on margins. Revenue growth underpinned by short term price cuts and aggressive Revenue accounting will fizzle out in long run. It is therefore important to analyze your Revenue drivers before reaching any conclusion about margin improvement. There are uncountable number of factors that may have both direct and indirect impact on Revenue. The three Key factors are summarized below:1.	Volume effects: because of discounts and price cutting. Typically price erosion is equal to List Price minus discount. It may lead to temporary increase in Sales but at the cost of margins. This tactic is employed in organizations where the Sales force is compensated by commissions anchored to Sales Volume.2.	Price effects: Increase in Price can also lead to Revenue growth. However, price increase can be driven by internal and external factors. Internal Price growth can come from a very strong brand in a less competitive market of slightly inelastic demand. External Price growth feeds from inflationary pressure & is undertaken by all competitors in unison. For example, an increase in Oil prices will lead to rise in transportation costs and it will drive up price of consumer products in a shock wave pattern.3.	Market Growth effects: Riding the growth of Market and economy is a convenient way to increase your revenues.

Purchasing Power Parity: Currencies of countries with lower inflation are expected to appreciate in future. Lower inflation implies lower interest rates and people will invest at lower rates only when they have positive expectations about future.2.	Interest Rate Parity (International Fisher Effect): Put simply, and assuming no transaction costs, it says that the spot and forward prices would entail interest rate differential between the two currencies. Higher domestic rates attract inflow of capital from abroad; lower rates have opposite effects.3.	Current Account: The deficit country would demand more foreign currency. Obviously this exceed demand would create downward pressure on the domestic exchange rate.4.	Terms of Trade: It is simply the ratio of export prices to import prices. If export prices increase by 10% and import prices by 7%, the terms of trade are 3% (positive range). This would reflect greater demand for exports and resultantly upward pressure on domestic currency.5.	Impact of Commodities: Currencies of countries like Canada and Australia are heavily linked to the Commodity prices.6.

(1413, 'Retirement risks in the context of key global and demographic changes, ', 'The objective of this article is to put retirement risks in the perspective of key global trends and changes. The economic collapse of 2008 left us pondering on the key question: can we control the timing of retirement? This event demonstrated the fact that the new economic realities warrant a great bullet proof strategy for retirement. The key risk faced by majority of baby boomers boils down to: would they be able to retire on time in an investment world awash with volatility and unpredictable markets? The key risk is longevity:		With medical advancement, your risk of mortality is much lower. In contrast, your risks of morbidity and longevity are much higher. Recent statistics point out that the average male lives to 76 and the average woman lives to 82. It is no surprise that these figures will improve in future as medical technology makes advance strides. Health costs should be tied to retirement:	The risk of death has decreased but the risk of not living healthy has ironically increased. Again statistics point out that 1 in 3 Canadians will get some type of critical disease. Health costs are increasing and so is the incidence of viral and bacterial diseases. The health systems are constrained by domestic demands and the latest trends point to global solutions to circumvent long wait times. All this points to an ever increasing health bill? How do you cover yourself under two different conditions? First you could be confronted by a temporary disability which does not let you work. Second, you could be confronted with an unexpected medical emergency, including major surgery or treatment. In this case, your need is not to replace the temporarily lost income but to get an appropriate lump sum payment for the treatment. In the world of insurance, the former case is of disability insurance and the latter points to critical insurance. 	Insuring against disability or critical insurance is absolutely critical. Why? If you do not have adequate protection, you will dip into your savings, including RRSP, to get money. This could be very costly if you cash out any portion of your RRSP due to serious tax implications. Any retirement plan must hedge the risks of health care costs by creating a contingency plan or buying disability and/or critical insurance. Procrastination and retirement 	Recent statistics have revealed that 2/3 of Canadians aiming to retire by 2030 are not contributing substantial money to actualize their retirement goals. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the only thing certain in the next decade is uncertainty of the capital markets. Investing without any financial advice can lead to a badly structured portfolio. This would gravitate into procrastination of retirement. What are some other factors which lead to misjudgements about the timings of retirement?-	Reliance on the Canada pension plan and old age security is not a good idea; and conservative analysis would typically exclude CPP from calculation of pensions.-	Most employees have historically moved from defined benefit towards defined contribution model; which puts more responsibility on the potential retirees than the company itself.-	You don’t pay yourself first and therefore not maximize RRSP.-	Demographics play an important role in shaping the retirement industry. The surge of baby boomers ahead will underscore demand for capital preservation amidst highly volatile capital markets. The key challenge is volatility and the main need is preservation of capital. Investors will demand downside risk management as much as returns. The ensuing volatility stems from three key factors: First, the low interest rate has created potential bubbles. Second, huge sovereign debt would cause macroeconomic instability. Third, the shift from the US to BRIC countries will be accompanied with increased volatility of capital markets. 	Most retirees don’t have the expertise and bandwidth to put their retirement goals in the perspective of key global trends. The economic crisis of 2008 emanating from the real estate bubble and mushroom growth of highly leveraged esoteric products points to the fact how fragile the world economy is.	The world is undergoing a sharp structural change. Global trade is most probably poised to shrink in the next decade due to three key factors: first, China and India will lead the way for strong economic and population growth as well as robust savings rates which together will help these nations build an internal mechanism of demand for their exports. This will reduce dependence on Europe and the US to absorb exports from China and India. Second, rising energy and commodity prices will reduce mobility of trade goods and localize most factors of production. Third, labor costs in developing high growth economies will rise leading to less advantage to outsourcing many of these services. 	Another key demographic trend is $3.7 trillion baby boomers industry in Canada which will dampen purchase of stocks in the next decade. Also, the lower level of consumer spending will dilute GDP growth. 	The best case scenario is underpinned by sideways volatile stock markets driven by persistent demand for the dividends stocks. The worst case scenario is deflation of the economy due to the busting of various bubbles like housing, oil, gold and stock market. The latter will keep the bond market afloat while shifting the centre of gravity to emerging markets fixed income securities. 	China and India will rise as significant economic powers in future. Their stocks will perform stronger than that of the US. This will do one thing for sure: drive up the prices of energy based commodities and natural resources. This would have positive impact on the economies of Canada and Australia. The retirement risk is the key risk 	The key risk for a great number of Canadians is the retirement risk itself. They are shy to put money in the markets with the fear of losing money. As pointed out by the data of statistics Canada, this inaction has resulted into $491 billion of unused RRSP contributions. This situation could be exacerbated by four alarming trends. First, the surge of baby boomers will greatly strain the government sources of help like the CPP. Second, employers are putting responsibility on their employees. Third, stock markets can potentially stay volatile and sideways due to great demographic transition in North America and the BRIC countries. Fourth, persistent low interest rate will create more bubbles which will only lend more volatility to the markets. The worst form of this instability could potentially lead into hyperinflation as the money supply continues to grow unabated. Prudent course of action	There could be many strategies to retire wisely. Here is a recap of four key strategies:1.	Diversification is the key area of focus. You must diversify across geographical areas, stocks & bonds as well as variety of assets for retirement. 2.	Hedge against volatility in the stock markets. Apply 60/40 rule of investing 60% in equities and the remaining 40% in stocks. 3.	Create alternative assets. For example, combine real estate investments to permanent insurance strategies and create a powerful combination which does three things: first, permanent insurance as a conservative investment balances your aggressive portfolio. Second, it allows tax-advantaged build-up of cash reserves inside your policy; and potentially hedges any risks of downturn in your real estate holdings. Third, permanent insurance while diversifying your portfolio also ensures efficient transfer of estate to the designated beneficiaries. Specifically, it covers loses from taxes and probate which cut onto the value of estate during estate transfer to beneficiaries; as well as hedges risks against creditors.4.	Cover up longevity risks by creating diversified assets. For example, if you have exhausted your retirement funds by age 65, you run the risk of longevity and living through the age of 85. How do you live in those twenty years, in particular when health costs are increasing as well? One potential solution is a combination of permanent life insurance and critical insurance. The former can build cash value to attend to the longevity risk while the latter can take care of unexpected medical emergencies most likely to occur in old age.

(1414, 'Key Difference between Mutual Funds and Segregated Funds, ', 'One key difference between Segregated Funds and Mutual Funds lies in the method of distribution by Trusts/Corporations which hold these assets. While Mutual Funds distribute capital gains in the form of dividends and interest income accrued from fixed investments; the Segregated Funds, which are Insurance contracts, go a step further to distribute both capital gains and capital losses. From this perspective, it is more beneficial to hold Segregated funds in your Portfolio-in so far you can apply capital losses to future capital gains and therefore optimize your tax liability.In Canada, dividends distribution is considered as capital gains in case of Mutual funds. This is an advantage because capital gains are taxed at 50% in Canada. If dividends are reinvested, they increase the Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) by that amount – this would minimize taxable gains in future. Thus dividend is simply a distribution of capital gain. 50% of net Capital gains is added to the investor income and taxed at their Marginal tax rate. Capital losses are not distributed in Mutual Fund distributions. However it is done in case of Segregated funds.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1416, 'Is there any difference between value & growth investing? ', 'Let me review the relationship between value and growth first. Value is greatly influenced by growth. The valuation of a company is based on how much cash the company can generate next year. This algorithm is captured in the famous Dividend Discount Model. This model assumes that the value of a company is the cash it will generate next year, divided by the required return minus the long term expected rate of the company’s Cash flows. Clearly, growth plays a critical role in determining the intrinsic value of a company. But there are five key questions to reconcile value of a stock & its assessment of growth potential:1. The sell side research analysis can make optimist assumptions about growth to inflate the value of stock.2. Growth prospects may overshoot the price of stocks-thus creating a divergence between value & growth.3.

(1417, 'Technology and Economics-The emerging Trends in 2013 ', ' Technology and Economics move in tandem. Technological advancement increases efficiency and productive capacity of the economy; which leads to long term economic growth and prosperity. Today’s competitive landscape of different technologies is under-pinned with intense rivalry, temporary disruption of existing technologies; followed by commoditization due to low cost barriers. Here are five recent examples of emerging technology trends:1-Stock Markets of World have become extremely volatile because information is executed instantaneously without giving any reaction time for market players to perceive the depth of fundamentals. It takes much longer to analyze the fundamentals of stocks than absorption of instantaneous messages bombarded in fractions of seconds. Such plethora of messages, coupled with Media hype, has created marked volatility in the Capital Markets of the world.2-Although Facebook and LinkedIn are not competitors in true sense, LinkedIn has done much better job in terms of cash generation; and consequently surge in its stock as compared to Facebook. The main driver behind cash generation is strategic positioning of LinkedIn in the talent acquisition industry, mainly in North America. This has enabled the company to double its stock in one year; whereas Facebook is still struggling to recover its stock lurking much below than its IPO point.3-There is an exponential growth of mammoth data, which determines the competitive landscape and future growth path of companies. Conventionally data was restricted to sales and inventory; which did not present holistic picture of a company’s performance. Now the trend is to embrace Big Data, entailing Social Media and Business Intelligence. There is a massive on-going demand for housing and securing this data using Cloud compatible solutions.4-Crowd-funding is another emerging trend backed by online technologies. If successful, it will disrupt the conventional venture capitalist model. From the perspective of technology, this model faces few challenges. However, from the regulations standpoint, there are formidable challenges, in particular for the conservative regulatory regimes like Canada. 5-The trend is also to “connect everything to internet” using mobile technologies. This ultra-integration would require extremely data intensive processes combined with telecommunications – all rolled onto the emerging world of cloud computing. However, this “technology utopia” of ultra-integration is replete with three key challenges: First, security of data in the world of cloud computing is a colossal challenge, although some companies like Blackberry claim to possess viable solutions. Second, telecommunication costs place constraint on what could be an optimal solution in terms of benefits versus costs. Third, it is rather difficult to work out a lean and sustainable model that avoids unnecessary information overload.To conclude, technology is playing an increasingly uncertain but very important role in shaping the contemporary world; and this has massive economic implications at both macro and micro levels. One key implication is that most disruptive technologies are invaded by glut of new entrants until that technology is commoditized to a great extent. This adds complexity to the fast changing landscape of new emerging technologies and how efficiently these could fulfill consumer demands.', 1, '2014-04-09 05:21:00', '2014-04-09 05:21:00', 0),
(1418, 'The Breakout Economies of the next decade, ', ' Most economists are making hyped predictions about across-the-board growth of BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) through 2050. The common prediction is that the next century is poised to bring “Asian greatness”; and East will rise again in its glory which existed many centuries back. The general trends of the decade preceding the 2008-2009 financial crisis, point toward some degree of “convergence” trend showing that the emerging economies (BRIC in particular) are catching up fast with the developed economies. This momentum may not continue with the same thrust as predicted by vast majority of economic and financial analysts due to the following reasons:(1)-The World economy and the stock markets are highly globalized and integrated. At the best, the general trend will be sluggish growth, due to emerging Sovereign debt crisis, and sideways markets. This trend will keep under check the growth of most emerging economies.(2)-The growth of BRIC economies is driven by divergent factors. For example Brazil and Russia are exporters of energy (Oil, Gas) while China boosts its growth from exports to Europe and the US. India is mainly exporter of Information Technology. The trends witnessed during the decade of great growth 1998-2008 may not repeat. For example, Chinese exports may decline due to cooling economies of Europe; the Oil exporting economies of Russia and Brazil might find hard time due to rising costs and lowering price (profits); and India may face some shift of its Information Technology exports to Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. (3)-The predictions for time period exceeding ten years are like fairy tales. It is not possible to make good predictions beyond one business cycle, typically five years or two business cycles at the most. Reports like Global Trends 2050 are less realistic.(4)-Some breakout economies with promising track-record, often ignored by economists, may show double-digit growth in the next decade: Nigeria, Bangladesh, South Korea, Czech Republic, Poland, Thailand and Philippines.Overall, the growth of emerging economies will be uneven, unpredictable and in line with key macroeconomic trends; deviating substantially from the current predictions of majority of economists and financial analysts.

(1419, 'The Great Asian Economic and Political Imbalance, ', ' The new American Foreign Policy Pivot has been designed to show “military and economic muscle” to the rising Chinese politico-economic power. The assumption in Obama’s camp is that the US naval and military presence must be revamped in Asia to keep the rising Chinese influence under check. This policy pivot may not be the right response given the current global and economic conditions due to the following reasons:(1)-China’s military and economic power has greater psychological effect on the US than any realistic dimensions of the issue. Needless to state that numbers and exaggerated forecasts (especially long term exceeding 10 years) standalone should not create the impression that China will soon excel the US as economic and military power.(2)-The new pivot in foreign policy will escalate arms and nuclear race in the region; and give opportunities to destabilization in the region.(3)-The fiscal deficit crisis in the US will lead to higher future debt rates, an attractive proposition to buy bonds from the US. The Chinese will resort to this purchase in order to demand more dollars and therefore keep local Chinese currency at lower rates. Weak Chinese currency helps in two ways: it promotes exports and it keeps rising prices under check. In other words, this global economic trend underpinned by the rising US debt paradoxically helps China to increase its external demand via competitive exports and internal demand via keeping inflation under control. Overall, the current US geopolitical and economic policy is exacerbating global imbalances in the Asian Region.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

(1420, 'The Nature of Greek Debt Crisis, ', 'The three indicators signaling economic concern are increased volatility in VIX (options related index) which measures the degree of fear on the Wall Street; strengthening of Swiss Franc, which is generally considered an indicator of secured currency amidst uncertainty; and finally an increase in the Credit Debt Swaps (CDS) for Greek bonds in Europe.The Greek debt crisis has three dimensions: political, cultural and economic. Democracies are sometimes fragile and governments spend extra cash to appease the opposition groups – thereby putting pressure on the Exchequer. The Greek crisis is “cultural” insofar that extravagant spending habits developed over a long period of time cannot be changed overnight by invoking austerity measures suddenly. Last but not least, the crisis has economic underpinnings in that any bad news would snow-ball into bunch of “potential debt problems” across Europe. It is not just Greece which is ailing from an ailing fiscal management apparatus – there are many other players in Europe as well.Any unilateral emergency funding by the European Central Bank will partially solve the problem. Ironically, any temporary solution would encourage a degree of “moral hazard” problems in the long haul. A more holistic solution would entail an effective alignment of discipline at two thresholds: effective management of fiscal discipline at national level and enforcement of transparent governance standards by the European Central Bank. This fragile balance is very important given the fact that the Global economic growth will be conditional on a smooth recovery path, where risks are mitigated through prudent management by the Central banks.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

The highly indebted countries of Europe have following debt to GDP ratios: Greece 189%, Italy 121%, and Portugal 115% & Ireland 118%.The austerity measures being designed will take a long time before these can effectively reduce the indebted ratios. Moreover, these austerity measures can push the highly indebted countries into a “catch 22” position as reduced spending & higher taxes will dampen the GDP growth, thereby offsetting any improvement in the debt to GDP ratio.

(1422, 'Economic oscillations in global financial markets 2012 ', 'Here is a summary of what has happened in the past few months and potential direction of investments:(1)-Economic data and statistics in North America has been trending positive and exceeding expectations. The US Consumer confidence is getting stronger; while Purchasing Managers index is recovering. Despite political dysfunction in the US, there is a degree of optimism about a potential rebounding of the US economy in 2012.(2)-Ever since 2007-2008, the global real rates have been declining consistently. One key factor is relatively stable rate of inflation. Fears of deflation still hang on due to massive deleveraging by the private sector in the US. The current stance of the Fed and other major central banks is to keep the interest rates depressed until 2013.(3)-Oil has surged in the past few months owing to geopolitical tensions with Iran. If Iran were to block strait of Hormuz, it could impact 20% of World oil supply line. OPEC claims to have spare capacity to offset such moves. Oil prices can have inflationary effect in near future, perhaps partially offsetting the decline of prices in the Natural gas sector.(4)-Europe remains a sensitive point for global financial markets. The European GDP has declined reflecting a degree of recession and fiscal tightening due to over-indebted European nations – primarily Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Both non-commercial loan supply and demand conditions have deteriorated in the Eurozone.(5)-The US housing seems to have bottomed with some signs of modest recovery. The incredibly low mortgage rates in combination with depressed prices cut to 1/3rd augur well for the affordability of the housing sector. The three key bottlenecks which prevent a huge rebound are surging inventories, relatively stagnant unemployment and tight credit conditions. The key metrics which are currently negative are mortgage delinquency and home foreclosure rate.(6)-The US consumer spending, in particular of households with income level of $100K to $250K, will determine the pace of US recovery. This category of consumers, numbering at 21 million, accounts for 40% of consumer spending in the US. They are a huge lever and any cautious spending by this class, as demonstrated in the recent surveys, can put brakes on the economy.(7)-The US employment rate is improving consistently; with fall in both jobless claims and lay-offs. The current economic situation warrants job creation of about 100,000 to 150,000 per month. At this pace, it may take another 2-3 years before recovery is achieved.(8)-The Canadian economy is dovetailing the US economy in terms of GDP growth – about 2% in 2012 and almost same threshold in 2013. The three key imbalances characterize the Canadian economy: rising household debt, inflated housing market and current account deficit.(9)-The Fitch ratings recently downgraded India’s credit outlook to negative, commenting that India’s economic outlook will decline without pacing up structural reforms. The key challenge is rising fiscal deficit of the government. The impact is slow economic growth at 5.3% in January, which is lowest in a decade; while hiking inflation continues to pose challenges.(10)-China is poised for soft landing, if not already happened in 2012 and 2013; with potential risks of hard landing in the decade ahead. The main challenge is significant transformation of the Chinese economy. Emerging markets, barring China and India, are lagging behind. All of this points to low global real rates in 2012 and 2013.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this Blog are my personal views/analysis.

Flat oil prices will strengthen consumer spending in the days ahead.(E)-Politics of fiscal debt management continues in the Eurozone. This instability is bound to trigger market volatility in the remaining 2012.(F)-The stock markets, both in the US and Canada, are undervalued. These are very attractive given robust corporate earnings of these companies.(G)-The bond market seemed to have reached its highest point – due to persistent low interest rates.

Do your own correct objective analysis without getting influenced by the herd, which in majority of cases will be wrong & converge to median (average) performance.3. The only way to win is to work hardest through voracious reading and application of intellectual curiosity.4. Strive for intellectual curiosity and keep asking three questions: why, why, and why?5. Develop analytical rigor and undertake holistic business analysis, inverting every situation, than merely focusing on markets, macroeconomic or price of stock individually.6. Do not fall in love with investment- be opportunity and situation driven.7. Einstein said that compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. Build patience & do not reverse investments unless there is a reason to do this.8. Become “decisive opportunist” & do not let opportunity slip away.9.

These reserves, estimated at 170 billion barrels, are greater than combined reserves of Iran and Russia – and are expected to generate 3.7 million barrels daily by 2025.The expected unprecedented surge in the demand of Oil in the next decade will give a trump card into the hands of the Canadian government to supply its Oil reserves to USA or China or both. This supply line can only materialize by building of a solid infrastructure & pipeline between the trading partners. Specifically this would involve secured pipelines between Alberta and Texas (for USA); another between Alberta and Shanghai traversing the Pacific Ocean (for China). Remember this venture is prone to environmental risks, including possible contamination of drinking water. If US environmentalists disapprove such an undertaking, Canada can have the option to tilt toward China, which has enormous appetite for energy in the next decade!Energy sector is the largest contributor to Gross domestic product of Alberta. According to the statistics 1ed by the Provincial government: “Alberta produces about five trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 250 million barrels of conventional oil, 500 million barrels of bitumen (a semi-solid form of crude oil) and, from 11 different mines, more than 30 million tons of coal each year.” The Albertan community has been characterized by Energy development.

(1807, 'Fixed income ETFs ', 'Fixed income ETFs securities serve two purposes: these are sources of income and balance out portfolio invested into equities. Recently, the fixed investments market has grown exponentially due to depressed interest rates, as corporate companies have leveraged their balance sheets using cheaper rates. The fixed investments market is many times the size of the equity market.  Fixed income securities are of different types: treasuries, mortgage backed securities (MBS), money markets, municipal bonds. Different ETFs track these types of fixed income securities. Fixed income securities have many risks with major ones as duration and credit risk. The advantage of using ETFs is low cost exposure to a spectrum of fixed investments, while circumventing risks associated with individual securities. The credit risk is represented by worthiness of the issuing entity. It is generally evaluated by its credit rating done by Standard & Poor and Moody’s. Debt issued by the US Government has no credit risk, although credit rating agencies downgraded the US bonds in the recent past. The second key factor is maturity, or the time it takes to redeem the Principal of bond. Duration is the quantitative measure of sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes. Two factors shape duration of bonds: coupon rate and maturity. Smaller coupons and longer maturity would increase duration, keeping other factors constant. Larger duration implies greater sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes. One key term in assessing fixed securities space is the credit spread. The key question is: what extra yield I am getting as compared to risk free rate, for assuming the extra risk? The more risky an investment, the greater will be the corresponding spread.

(1809, 'Commodity ETFs ', 'Commodities do not represent any direct investment in the company or its debt structure. They encompass actual materials like crude oil, natural gas, precious metals and food commodities. Commodities offer appreciation potential like stocks but do not offer income like dividend paying stocks and bonds. The key advantage of including commodities in the portfolio is the degree of non-correlation of this sector to conventional stocks and bonds sectors. This diversification adds huge advantage in highly volatile markets of today.Commodities’ prices have been volatile like stock markets since 2008. In the long run, the trend is towards increase in prices of commodities, driven by both increased demand and constrained supply globally. Lately food prices have increased due to demographic and consumption patterns in the emerging economies. Yet commodities provide excellent hedge against inflation. The demand is elevating due to growth factors in the emerging economies – China, India, Brazil and next 11 countries are gobbling commodities. On the supply side, the current arteries of supply related to oil and gas have been constrained and not keeping pace with the demand levels.Focus on unconventional hydrocarbons like shale gas, coal-bed methane, deep – water oil and tar sands have escalated the costs of supply-line. Overall, the prices of commodities remain elevated and unlike stocks or bonds are not exposed to any potential free fall.Probably, owning the commodities direct way is more efficient in order to get exposure to them than investing in companies which produce metals and commodities per se. Ironically, stocks prices of commodities are soaring. This paradox is explained by the fact that the key determinant of stock prices is expectation of earnings, which is related to multiple factors including depth and integrity of management. In short soaring commodities’ prices do not necessarily lead to rising stock prices of companies utilising them as raw materials.With both ETFs and ETNs (exchange traded notes are senior, unsecured debt), one can get exposure to broad – based commodities as well as specific commodities. Commodities are broadly categorized into four categories: energy, precious metals, industrial commodities and agricultural. ETFs are available under each of the above categories. The broadest ETF commodities fund is the iPath DOW-JONES AIG Commodity Index Total. The underlying index comprises of nineteen commodities organized into five sectors: energy, industrial metals, agriculture, livestock and precious metals. The index is heavily weighted to agriculture and livestock, and is therefore a good reflection of ensuing inflationary trends. On the narrower side of spectrum, there are many funds, which track either a specific group or a specific commodity. For example, copper is widely dependent on anticipated economic growth and its ETF is a leading indicator of oncoming economic trends.', 1, '2014-06-15 14:49:35', '2014-06-15 14:49:35', 0),
(1810, 'Retirement risks in the context of key global and demographic changes, ', 'The objective of this article is to put retirement risks in the perspective of key global trends and changes. The economic collapse of 2008 left us pondering on the key question: can we control the timing of retirement? This event demonstrated the fact that the new economic realities warrant a great bullet proof strategy for retirement. The key risk faced by majority of baby boomers boils down to: would they be able to retire on time in an investment world awash with volatility and unpredictable markets?The key risk is longevity:With medical advancement, your risk of mortality is much lower. In contrast, your risks of morbidity and longevity are much higher. Recent statistics point out that the average male lives to 76 and the average woman lives to 82. It is no surprise that these figures will improve in future as medical technology makes advance strides.Health costs should be tied to retirement:The risk of death has decreased but the risk of not living healthy has ironically increased. Again statistics point out that 1 in 3 Canadians will get some type of critical disease. Health costs are increasing and so is the incidence of viral and bacterial diseases. The health systems are constrained by domestic demands and the latest trends point to global solutions to circumvent long wait times. All this points to an ever increasing health bill? How do you cover yourself under two different conditions? First you could be confronted by a temporary disability which does not let you work. Second, you could be confronted with an unexpected medical emergency, including major surgery or treatment. In this case, your need is not to replace the temporarily lost income but to get an appropriate lump sum payment for the treatment. In the world of insurance, the former case is of disability insurance and the latter points to critical insurance.Insuring against disability or critical insurance is absolutely critical. Why? If you do not have adequate protection, you will dip into your savings, including RRSP, to get money. This could be very costly if you cash out any portion of your RRSP due to serious tax implications. Any retirement plan must hedge the risks of health care costs by creating a contingency plan or buying disability and/or critical insurance.Procrastination and retirementRecent statistics have revealed that 2/3 of Canadians aiming to retire by 2030 are not contributing substantial money to actualize their retirement goals. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the only thing certain in the next decade is uncertainty of the capital markets. Investing without any financial advice can lead to a badly structured portfolio. This would gravitate into procrastination of retirement. What are some other factors which lead to misjudgements about the timings of retirement?- Reliance on the Canada pension plan and old age security is not a good idea; and conservative analysis would typically exclude CPP from calculation of pensions.- Most employees have historically moved from defined benefit towards defined contribution model; which puts more responsibility on the potential retirees than the company itself.- You don’t pay yourself first and therefore not maximize RRSP.- Demographics play an important role in shaping the retirement industry. The surge of baby boomers ahead will underscore demand for capital preservation amidst highly volatile capital markets. The key challenge is volatility and the main need is preservation of capital. Investors will demand downside risk management as much as returns. The ensuing volatility stems from three key factors: First, the low interest rate has created potential bubbles. Second, huge sovereign debt would cause macroeconomic instability. Third, the shift from the US to BRIC countries will be accompanied with increased volatility of capital markets.Most retirees don’t have the expertise and bandwidth to put their retirement goals in the perspective of key global trends. The economic crisis of 2008 emanating from the real estate bubble and mushroom growth of highly leveraged esoteric products points to the fact how fragile the world economy is.The world is undergoing a sharp structural change. Global trade is most probably poised to shrink in the next decade due to three key factors: first, China and India will lead the way for strong economic and population growth as well as robust savings rates which together will help these nations build an internal mechanism of demand for their exports. This will reduce dependence on Europe and the US to absorb exports from China and India. Second, rising energy and commodity prices will reduce mobility of trade goods and localize most factors of production. Third, labor costs in developing high growth economies will rise leading to less advantage to outsourcing many of these services.Another key demographic trend is $3.7 trillion baby boomers industry in Canada which will dampen purchase of stocks in the next decade. Also, the lower level of consumer spending will dilute GDP growth.The best case scenario is underpinned by sideways volatile stock markets driven by persistent demand for the dividends stocks. The worst case scenario is deflation of the economy due to the busting of various bubbles like housing, oil, gold and stock market. The latter will keep the bond market afloat while shifting the centre of gravity to emerging markets fixed income securities.China and India will rise as significant economic powers in future. Their stocks will perform stronger than that of the US. This will do one thing for sure: drive up the prices of energy based commodities and natural resources. This would have positive impact on the economies of Canada and Australia.The retirement risk is the key riskThe key risk for a great number of Canadians is the retirement risk itself. They are shy to put money in the markets with the fear of losing money. As pointed out by the data of statistics Canada, this inaction has resulted into $491 billion of unused RRSP contributions. This situation could be exacerbated by four alarming trends. First, the surge of baby boomers will greatly strain the government sources of help like the CPP. Second, employers are putting responsibility on their employees. Third, stock markets can potentially stay volatile and sideways due to great demographic transition in North America and the BRIC countries. Fourth, persistent low interest rate will create more bubbles which will only lend more volatility to the markets. The worst form of this instability could potentially lead into hyperinflation as the money supply continues to grow unabated.Prudent course of actionThere could be many strategies to retire wisely. Here is a recap of four key strategies:1. Diversification is the key area of focus. You must diversify across geographical areas, stocks &amp; bonds as well as variety of assets for retirement.2. Hedge against volatility in the stock markets. Apply 60/40 rule of investing 60% in equities and the remaining 40% in stocks.3. Create alternative assets. For example, combine real estate investments to permanent insurance strategies and create a powerful combination which does three things: first, permanent insurance as a conservative investment balances your aggressive portfolio. Second, it allows tax-advantaged build-up of cash reserves inside your policy; and potentially hedges any risks of downturn in your real estate holdings. Third, permanent insurance while diversifying your portfolio also ensures efficient transfer of estate to the designated beneficiaries. Specifically, it covers loses from taxes and probate which cut onto the value of estate during estate transfer to beneficiaries; as well as hedges risks against creditors.4. Cover up longevity risks by creating diversified assets. For example, if you have exhausted your retirement funds by age 65, you run the risk of longevity and living through the age of 85. How do you live in those twenty years, in particular when health costs are increasing as well? One potential solution is a combination of permanent life insurance and critical insurance. The former can build cash value to attend to the longevity risk while the latter can take care of unexpected medical emergencies most likely to occur in old age.', 1, '2014-06-15 14:50:42', '2014-06-15 14:50:42', 0),
(1811, 'Technology and Economics-The emerging Trends in 2013 ', 'Technology and Economics move in tandem. Technological advancement increases efficiency and productive capacity of the economy; which leads to long term economic growth and prosperity. Today’s competitive landscape of different technologies is under-pinned with intense rivalry, temporary disruption of existing technologies; followed by commoditization due to low cost barriers. Here are five recent examples of emerging technology trends:1-Stock Markets of World have become extremely volatile because information is executed instantaneously without giving any reaction time for market players to perceive the depth of fundamentals. It takes much longer to analyze the fundamentals of stocks than absorption of instantaneous messages bombarded in fractions of seconds. Such plethora of messages, coupled with Media hype, has created marked volatility in the Capital Markets of the world.2-Although Facebook and LinkedIn are not competitors in true sense, LinkedIn has done much better job in terms of cash generation; and consequently surge in its stock as compared to Facebook. The main driver behind cash generation is strategic positioning of LinkedIn in the talent acquisition industry, mainly in North America. This has enabled the company to double its stock in one year; whereas Facebook is still struggling to recover its stock lurking much below than its IPO point.3-There is an exponential growth of mammoth data, which determines the competitive landscape and future growth path of companies. Conventionally data was restricted to sales and inventory; which did not present holistic picture of a company’s performance. Now the trend is to embrace Big Data, entailing Social Media and Business Intelligence. There is a massive on-going demand for housing and securing this data using Cloud compatible solutions.4-Crowd-funding is another emerging trend backed by online technologies. If successful, it will disrupt the conventional venture capitalist model. From the perspective of technology, this model faces few challenges. However, from the regulations standpoint, there are formidable challenges, in particular for the conservative regulatory regimes like Canada.5-The trend is also to “connect everything to internet” using mobile technologies. This ultra-integration would require extremely data intensive processes combined with telecommunications – all rolled onto the emerging world of cloud computing. However, this “technology utopia” of ultra-integration is replete with three key challenges: First, security of data in the world of cloud computing is a colossal challenge, although some companies like Blackberry claim to possess viable solutions. Second, telecommunication costs place constraint on what could be an optimal solution in terms of benefits versus costs. Third, it is rather difficult to work out a lean and sustainable model that avoids unnecessary information overload.To conclude, technology is playing an increasingly uncertain but very important role in shaping the contemporary world; and this has massive economic implications at both macro and micro levels. One key implication is that most disruptive technologies are invaded by glut of new entrants until that technology is commoditized to a great extent. This adds complexity to the fast changing landscape of new emerging technologies and how efficiently these could fulfill consumer demands.', 1, '2014-06-15 14:52:37', '2014-06-15 14:52:37', 0);
